    "title": "Forced-alignment and segmentation of airflow data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An airflow system like the SQLab EVA2 used in our lab creates separate wav-like files for audio, oral airflow, and nasal airflow. Usually we use a program like wavesurfer or Praat to view these files and extract our measurements.\nBut what if you want to extract measurements for all of the segments in a reasonably-sized corpus of continuous speech? This can, of course, be done by hand but the process is tedious, labor-intensive, and inescapably subjective. This tutorial explains how to use Praat and HTK to segment audio recordings and use that segmentation to extract phone-level airflow data for an entire corpus. The segmentation is unlikely to be as good as a trained linguist might achieve, but it’s definitely faster and a very good starting point. The corpus I’m working with is a set of recordings of the TIMIT prompts I made for my doctoral candidacy qualifying project: Modeling Airflow for Concatenative Speech Synthesis.\nSolution\n\nConvert the EVA2 files to WAV format.\n\nSQLab distribute a piece of Windows-only, closed-source software called RIFF Edit for converting from their proprietary format to WAV format. Works great on my Mac using CrossOver which, I believe, is just a very nice version of wine.\n\nBreak the audio recordings up into separate files (one prompt/sentence per file) Of course there are many ways to do this. Usually one would record each prompt separately so that the audio files are naturally in separate files. The clumsy EVA2 system makes this arrangement difficult, though, so I used a TextGrid to mark each prompt on an interval tier. This can be done automatically using Praat’s “Annotate –&gt; To TextGrid (Silences)” command (some clean-up is usually necessary, but it saves a lot of work). Once the prompts are marked in the TextGrid I run this Praat script that I did not write.\n\n( As a quick aside, Kyle Gorman has written a terrific little Python class for manipulating TextGrids –does exactly what you’d want in just exactly the way you’d probably expect. )\n\nNow use the same TextGrid and script to extract prompts from the OAF (oral airflow) and NAF (nasal airflow) files.\n\nThis is the great strength of using something like Praat in the first place. Be sure to check a random sample of your alignments to make sure everything worked, but I’ve never had a problem.\n\nLabel all three files properly\n\nMy utterances are in a file called utts.data (identical to the file needed by Festival for voice creation) with the format:\n(audio_0003 \"This was easy for us.\")\n(audio_0004 \"Jane may earn more money by working hard.\")\n(audio_0005 \"She is thinner than I am.\")\n(audio_0006 \"Bright sunshine shimmers on the ocean.\")\n(audio_0007 \"Nothing is as offensive as innocence.\")\n(audio_0008 \"Why yell or worry over silly items?\")\n(audio_0009 \"Where were you while we were away?\")\n \nAnd then I run the shell script mkpf.sh to double check the audio and create the prompt files.\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport UTTS=../utts.data\n\necho which file are we starting with [ 1 = first ]?\nread START;\n\nif [ \"$START\" == \"\" ]; then\n     START=1\nfi\n\nfor i in `ls a*.wav | sort -n -k1.2`; do\n    num=`printf \"%04d\" $START`\n\n    line=`grep \"audio_$num\" $UTTS`\n    prompt=`echo $line | awk -F\\\" '{print $2}'`\n    echo $line\n    afplay $i;\n    echo make $i $num [y] ?;\n\n    read ANSWER;\n\n    if [ \"$ANSWER\" == \"n\" ]; then\n        echo doing nothing\n    else\n        if [ \"$ANSWER\" == \"p\" ]; then\n            let \"START = START - 1\"\n            num=`printf \"%04d\" $START`\n\n            echo overwriting $i to $num ...\n        else\n            echo saving $i to $num ...\n        fi\n\n        cp $i audio_${num}.wav\n        cp oaf_$i oaf_${num}.wav\n        cp naf_$i naf_${num}.wav\n        echo $prompt &gt; ${num}.txt\n        rm $i\n\n        let \"START = START + 1\"\n    fi\ndone"

    "title": "Easy, readable css interlinear glosses",
    "section": "",
    "text": "CSS should make the creation and sharing of standard interlinear glosses/translations easy; so far it does not. In general, either the text entry or the output (or both!) is absolutely unacceptable. For example:\n&lt;h1&gt;John 3:16&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"unit\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"gk\"&gt;οὕτως&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"en\"&gt;such&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"unit\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"gk\"&gt;γὰρ&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"en\"&gt;for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"unit\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"gk\"&gt;ἠγάπησεν&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"en\"&gt;loved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n \nNotice that any sense of these translated words having some pairwise (let alone phrasal, clause, or sentence!) structure is completely shrouded in the cumbersome and obtrusive markup (this would also be a huge pain to type). The output is admittely really nice and allows one to do some cool things with javascript, but the text is essentially unusable in this form. If I wanted 4,000,000 tags per document I’d use XML/XSLT (p.s. yuck).\nThe goal, it seems,is something more like the entry one uses in gb4e.sty glosses in a LaTeX document:\n\\begin{exe} \n\\ex \n\\gll Wenn jemand in die W\\\"uste zieht ... \\\\ \nIf someone in the desert draws and lives ... \\\\ \n\\trans ‘if one retreats to the desert and ... ’ \n\\end{exe} \n \ngb4e/LaTeX handle making words that are glosses of one another line up in the display. In short, the goal is separation of content from display and that’s the entire bloody point of CSS, right?\nWhat I’d really like is text entry like this:\n&lt;div class=\"interlinear\"&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"source\"&gt;T&aacute; ceol agam. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"gloss\"&gt;to be-PRS music-M.PL at-1SG&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"target\"&gt;I am musical&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n \nIn addition to the problem that CSS is basically incapable of doing any kind of interesting text alignment, this example introduces the complication of aligning multiple words to a single word. What I have so far is text entry using the CSS inline-table attribute like this:\n&lt;div class=\"interlinear\"&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"gloss\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"gll\"&gt;T&aacute;&lt;br /&gt;to be-PRS&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"gll\"&gt;ceol&lt;br /&gt;music-M.PL&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"gll\"&gt;agam&lt;br /&gt;at-1SG&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"translation\"&gt;I am musical&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n \nwhich, I think, still totally sucks. There’s less markup than the first version so it’s slightly better, but it’s still not very good. Two good things, though, are that the CSS is obvious, simple and standard (interlinear.css) and the output is nice:\n\n\n\nIrish\n\n\nTáto be-PRS\n\n\nceolmusic-M.PL\n\n\nagamat-1SG\n\n\n\nI am musical\n\n\n\nLatin\n\n\nIn  in\n\n\nnomine  name\n\n\nPatris  Father\n\n\net  and\n\n\nFilii  Son\n\n\net  and\n\n\nSpiritus  Spirit\n\n\nSancti  Holy\n\n\n\nIn the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n\nClassical Japanese (Ariwara no Narihira courtesy E.

And isn’t spring the way it used to be?”\n\n\n\n \nI have a little javascript hack that will assemble these inline-table divs at run time from the first type of HTML. This allows me to write markup in the style I want but it’s gross and still doesn’t facilitate searching. I’ll update this page when I come up with something better (or you could e-mail me if you have a better idea)."

    "text": "2019 Linguistic Institute: Speech Perception (221) Patrice (Pam) Speeter Beddor beddor@umich.edu Kevin B. McGowan kbmcgowan@uky.edu\nMonday & Thursday 1:05-2:30 pm\nExperimental speech perception, which spans a period of more than 70 years, investigates how listeners interpret the input acoustic signal as linguistic forms. From the discipline’s earliest years, researchers recognized that the acoustic signal is highly variable and that perceptual processing is more complex (and interesting!) than a simple one-to-one mapping between acoustic property and linguistic percept. Yet, despite this complexity, humans are highly accurate perceivers of the intended speech in typical conversational interactions.\nThis course will provide students with an overview of the dominant theories of speech perception and the theoretical issues that drive empirical studies, including the fundamental question of whether speech perception differs from other types of auditory processing. Readings, course discussions, and hands-on experience with classic speech perception experiments will guide students through the field’s evolution from an emphasis on psychoacoustics and the acoustic signal to an appreciation for the structured nature of variation and how it informs perception. We will discover together that, while listeners closely attend to the structured variation, individual listeners do so in ways that depend on their linguistic experiences, social expectations, processing style, and more. Listeners are active participants who recruit multiple cognitive resources in achieving malleable, dynamic perception.\n\nBackground: Students may find having some familiarity with acoustic phonetics helpful (although this background is not essential for this course). Excellent chapters include these:\n\no Raphael, L.J., Borden, G.J., & Harris, K.S. 2011. Speech Science Primer. Philadelphia, PA: Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott. 6th edition, chapters 5 & 6. o Reetz, H. & Jongman, A. 2008. Phonetics: Transcription, Production, Acoustics, and Perception. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. 1st edition, chapters 9 & 10. o Ladefoged, P. & Johnson, K. 2015. A Course in Phonetics. Boston, MA: Thomson. 6th edition, chapter 8. * Readings: There is no expectation that you will have time, during the busy weeks of the Institute, to read more than one paper per class meeting. For each class meeting, the syllabus marks the most strongly recommended reading in bold. (You might view other readings as background material that you may wish to consult after the Institute is over.) * Writing assignment: A roughly 500 word research prospectus for an original, theoretically motivated speech perception experiment or a two-page critical assessment, supported by experimental evidence from the literature, of a well-defined issue in speech perception. Students are encouraged to get together with Pam or Kevin to run their ideas past us before submitting their paper, which is due July 18 (11:59 pm)."

The instructor’s background is in phonetics and speech perception so there will necessarily be an emphasis on visual-world eye-tracking research in spoken word recognition.

Students completing this course will have the background needed to read, understand, and evaluate eye tracking literature. You will also have the foundation needed to design, implement, and analyze your own original eye tracking research. We will read and discuss foundational literature applying eye tracking to linguistic questions as well as a range of more recent papers covering both methodological and theoretical concerns.

The inhabitants of these camps seek to engage the world in a dialogue, and although they speak a variety of languages, the voices the refugees and migrants in The Jungle of Calais raise through their protest placards and graffiti are more homogeneous.

Using the techniques of linguistic landscapes, this paper analyzes the linguistic material of The Jungle. Like other recent works on the linguistic landscapes of protest, this analysis challenges the idea that territory is a fixed place or space (Kasanga, 2014), asserting rather that the migrants/refugees are co-creating a collective space that exists more through their raised voices, and less in the physical space they temporarily inhabit.\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13023/ETD.2016.210"

This study consists of two experiments  the first a listener judgment based Likert scale, the second an AXB study. The first experiment used modal and creaky voice statement-of-fact tokens to determine whether the speaker is or isn’t x characteristic (intelligent, feminine, educated, masculine, hesitant, and confident). This study found that both male and female speakers were found to be less intelligent, less educated, less feminine, more masculine, less confident, and more hesitant when using creaky voice phonation as compared to the modal register. Participants also rated male and female speakers as statistically different. During the second experiment the participants listened to continuums that went from modal register to extreme creaky voice (based on F0 levels). Participants performed an AXB task to determine ability at distinguishing levels of creaky voice along the continuum.

Variation in pronunciation is socially informative, and listeners can draw on these social expectations when perceiving speech. This dissertation argues for a closer consideration of variation within sociophonetic exemplar modeling. I do this by reviewing the web of literature, simulating perception events in Python, and conducting an experiment. “Exemplar theory” is a class of models positing that past experiences interpreting stimuli are remembered as exemplars; new stimuli are categorized based on comparison to these stored memories. In particular, I focus on the Generalized Context Model (Nosofsky 1986; Johnson 1997), or GCM. The evidence that social categories, like other higher-order abstractions from stimuli, can play a role in categorization is well-established but loosely unified. Many adopt an episodic or exemplar-based framework in interpreting their results, but focus on the general patterns more than a specific model. I developed a Python library ExemPy which implements the GCM and provides routines for simulating common perception experiment tasks. I suggest applications for both enhancing empirical work and exploring theoretical space. I designed an experiment to explore a key difference among sociophonetic priming literature: whether social expectation is invoked as part of or outside of the phonetic stimulus.

More recent studies have established that listeners are sensitive to cues in both these modalities which inform their perception of a speaker’s identity in parallel with the linguistic message, but the relationship between social information in perception and production together is unclear. This study reports the results of an experiment designed to test the hypothesis that expectations about a speakers identity is able to influence a listener’s perception and production of speech in tandem. The shadowing task addresses the degree to which listeners faithfully reproduce L2 accented English when presented with four ethnically distinct faces in congruent and incongruent auditory-visual pairs in a within-subject design. Analyses of the degree of acoustic similarity to model talkers in speakers’ imitations revealed a slight average trend toward convergence on vowel spectra, vowel duration, and average fundamental frequency. Significant predictors of the degree of change in a speaker’s production were shown to be the vowel quality measured and the voice presented, but these predictors were agnostic with respect to whether these changes represented phonetic convergence or divergence. The variance in degree of similarity suggests that speakers’ convergence is subject to linguistic selectivity, but it is less clear the role social selectivity plays when presented with unfamiliar varieties. Overall these findings are consistent with exemplar models which consider the inherent coupling of individuals’ speech perception and production, but that the visual stimuli had no significant effect on these analyses may be reflective of listeners’ adaptive processes during perception of L2-accented speech.\nhttps://uknowledge.uky.edu/ltt_etds/41/"

    "text": "“The thing about speech is, it varies.” (Remirez, in press). But for a number of historical and disciplinary reasons (see McGowan, in press), it feels normal for people in my field to talk about how listeners are “confronted with” tremendous variation in speech or to think about and write about variation as a big problem that listeners have to solve. I think this is a real shame.\n\n\n\nHi! My research takes the position that listeners are sensitive to patterns of covariation in speech and that knowing (more on ‘knowing’ later) these subtle patterns is part of what it means to truly know a language.\n\n\n\n\nWhy? Because speech is social. When we speak, we communicate not only our ideas, but also numerous social cues about who we are, where we come from, what we think you already know, who we think is listening, and many other details…\n\n\n\nWhich is great because if people sound the way we expect them to, we’re able to understand them better (McGowan, 2015; 2012 LSA presentation)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is true even when our expectations are based on stereotypes rather than authentic experience (McGowan, 2017)!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sumner, Kim, King, and McGowan (2014) we propose a model (below) of how the linguistic and the social aspects of speech interact to support perception.\n\n\n\n\nIn this model, we propose that listeners process both phonetically cued social information and phonetically cued linguistic information prior to word recognition and that these dual routes can interact to guide and facilitate perception.\n\n\n\nFor example, when Anna Babel and I told Bolivian listeners to expect Quechua-accented Spanish, they perceived vowels completely differently than if they were told to anticipate a Spanish accent (McGowan and Babel, 2020)\n\n\nThis suggests that experienced listeners have detailed knowledge of phonetically-cued social information —so expecting the variation consistent with a particular social category can change the way we perceive vowels. Social information isn’t noise to be thrown away, it is an essential part of the signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here’s that word know again! Knowledge is not the same thing as awareness. We told listeners they’d changed speakers (from Quechua to Spanish or vice versa) and while they gave every indication of believing the switch their low level perceptual behavior stayed the same!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo does all this knowledge and sensitivity only apply to social variation?\n\n\n\nFirst, some quick background on how sounds like [p], [t], and [k] differ from sounds like [b], [d], and [g] at the beginning of English words like pit and bit. What word is this native American English speaker saying? Does it sound like ‘pit’ or ‘bit’ to you?     Your browser does not support the audio element. \n\n\n\n The image to the left is a spectrogram (frequency analysis over time) of the word pit. Hear the puff of air at the beginning? It is highlighted in blue.    Your browser does not support the audio element.  \n pit and bit both start with the lips completely closed. One of the main differences between them is the duration of the puff of air, this duration is called VOT (voice onset time).    Your browser does not support the audio element. \n \n\n[pʰɪt]\n\n\n[bɪt]\n\n\n\nAt least in American English, that puff of air is so important that if we cut it out of pit (this was that first sound you played! ‘pit’ with the puff removed) it results in a word that sounds to English-knowing listeners a lot like bit —though probably with maybe a funny [b], and that funniness is every bit as interesting and important as the change from [p] to [b]!\n\n\n\nAnother covarying feature is the way vowels before nasal consonants in English tend to be nasalized. Listeners can use this as soon as it becomes available, not only a large distinction like bend/bed…   Your browser does not support the audio element.    Your browser does not support the audio element. \n\n\nbut also a much more subtle distinction like the difference in nasalization between these two sound files. Can you hear a difference?\n\n\n\n This first recording has late nasalization starting 100 miliseconds after the [b].   Your browser does not support the audio element. \n This second recording has early nasalization starting 33 miliseconds after the [b].   Your browser does not support the audio element. \n\n\n\n\nIn an eye tracking task we found that listeners can use nasalization as soon as it is present. Looks to the heavily-nasalized word were, on average, 60 ms faster —the same average difference between early and late nasalization in the recordings (Beddor, McGowan, Boland, Coetzee, and Brasher, 2013).\n\n\n\n\nWhether the information is social, contextual, articulatory, or idiosyncratic, we humans have an astonishing ability to attend to it, remember it, and activate it during perception. This ability, my research suggests, is not irrelevant to linguistic competence or even peripheral to it, it is fundamentally and centrally part of what it means to know and speak a human language.\n\n\n Thank you for reading!

The study combines quantitative methods of acoustic analysis and experimental design with qualitative methods of semi-structured interviews and content analysis. The study focuses on second language speakers’ variation in ‘passing for a native speaker’, that is, being regarded as a first language speaker. Variation in passing is explored from the perspectives of variation in production and perception. 18 second language speakers of English (first language Korean and German) and 6 first language speakers of English were recorded in four different settings (family, friends, services, and university). In the production study, the second language speakers’ monophthongal vowels are analyzed in comparison with the first language vowels and New Zealand English ones. The speakers were found to style-shift in their production of the first and second formants of certain vowels in different settings: the German speakers were more English-target-like in the services setting and the Korean speakers were more English-target-like in the services setting and less English-target-like in the family setting compared to the university one, exhibiting a continuum of native-likeness in the three settings. Three perception experiments complement the production analysis. Two of these focus on the effect of setting in accentedness perception and passing for a native speaker, and one explores the effect of social information (namely, ethnicity) on accentedness perception. The speakers were found to receive a different accentedness rating depending on the recording setting and whether or not the listener was aware of their ethnicity. Specifically, some speakers were rated less accented in the services setting and some in the family setting compared to the university one. Also, Asian speakers were rated similarly for accentedness both when the listeners were provided with video input and when they were not, but Caucasian speakers were rated more accented when the video input was available. Additionally, the thesis addresses passing for a native speaker of different English varieties in an experimental context. It reveals interesting trends in the speakers’ variation of passing in different settings and passing for native speakers of different varieties. The family setting was conducive to passing, and some speakers passed for a native speaker of the same variety more often than for a native speaker of other varieties and some vice versa. Finally, the second language speakers’ beliefs about passing and listeners’ comments on their decision-making in identifying the origin of the speakers are investigated. The results showed that the speakers believed that first (and short) encounters with strangers were conducive to passing. A variety of linguistic and extralinguistic listener comments was revealed. Taken together, the results paint a complex picture of variation in second language speakers’ production, accentedness perception, and passing for a native speaker. The findings suggest that speakers vary in their production according to audience and in the construction of their identities. The perception experiments highlight the effect of listener expectation on their perception.

    "text": "This thesis examines the flexibility and context-sensitivity of speech perception by looking at a domain not often explored in the study of language cognition — popular music. Three empirical studies are presented. The first examines the current state of sociolinguistic variation in commercial popular music, while the second and third explore everyday listeners’ perception of language in musical and non-musical contexts. The foundational assumption of the thesis is that the use of ‘American English’ in song is automatic for New Zealand singers, and constitutes a responsive style that is both accurate and consistent. The use of New Zealand English in song, by contrast, is stylised, involving an initiative act of identity and requiring effort and awareness. This will be discussed in Chapter 1, where I also introduce the term Standard Popular Music Singing Style (SPMSS) to refer to the US English-derived phonetic style dominant in popular song.  The first empirical study will be presented in Chapter 2. Using a systematically selected corpus of commercial pop and hip hop from NZ and the USA, analysis of non-prevocalic and linking /r/, and the vowels of the bath, lot and goat lexical sets confirm that SPMSS is highly normative in NZ music. Most pop singers closely follow US patterns, while several hip hop artists display elements of New Zealand English. This reflects the value placed on authenticity in hip hop, and also interacts with ethnicity, showing the use of different authentication practices by P¯akeh¯a (NZ European) and M¯aori/Pasifika artists. By looking at co-variation amongst the variables, I explore both the apparent identity goals of the artists, and the relative salience of the variables. Chapters 3 and 4 use the results of the corpus analysis to explore how the dominance of SPMSS affects speech processing.  The first of the two perception experiments is a phonetic categorisation task. Listeners decide whether they hear the word bed or bad in a condition where the stimuli are either set to music, or appear in one of two non-musical control conditions. The stimuli are on a resynthesised continuum between the dress and trap vowels, passing through an F1 space where the vowel is ambiguous and could either be perceived as a spoken NZE trap or a sung dress. When set to music, the NZ listeners perceive the vowel according to expectations of SPMSS (i.e. expecting US-derived vowel qualities). The second perception experiment is a lexical decision task that uses the natural speech of a NZ and a US speaker, once again in musical and non-musical conditions. Participants’ processing of the US voice is facilitated in the music condition, becoming faster than reaction times to their native dialect.  Bringing the results of the corpus and perception studies together, this thesis shows that SPMSS is highly normative in NZ popular music not just for performers, but also in the minds of the general music-listening public. I argue that many New Zealanders are bidialectal, with native-like knowledge of SPMSS. Speech and song are two highly distinct and perceptually contrastive contexts of language use. By differing from conversational language across a range of perceptual and cognitive dimensions, language heard or produced in song is likely to encode and activate a distinct subset of auditory memories. The contextual specificity of such networks may then allow for the abstraction of an independent sub-system of sociophonetic knowledge specific to the musical context.\nhttps://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/items/4026429a-a08d-4e16-a4e9-0441e9bf5eb0"

The first examines the current state of sociolinguistic variation in commercial popular music, while the second and third explore everyday listeners’ perception of language in musical and non-musical contexts. The foundational assumption of the thesis is that the use of ‘American English’ in song is automatic for New Zealand singers, and constitutes a responsive style that is both accurate and consistent. The use of New Zealand English in song, by contrast, is stylised, involving an initiative act of identity and requiring effort and awareness. This will be discussed in Chapter 1, where I also introduce the term Standard Popular Music Singing Style (SPMSS) to refer to the US English-derived phonetic style dominant in popular song.  The first empirical study will be presented in Chapter 2. Using a systematically selected corpus of commercial pop and hip hop from NZ and the USA, analysis of non-prevocalic and linking /r/, and the vowels of the bath, lot and goat lexical sets confirm that SPMSS is highly normative in NZ music. Most pop singers closely follow US patterns, while several hip hop artists display elements of New Zealand English. This reflects the value placed on authenticity in hip hop, and also interacts with ethnicity, showing the use of different authentication practices by P¯akeh¯a (NZ European) and M¯aori/Pasifika artists. By looking at co-variation amongst the variables, I explore both the apparent identity goals of the artists, and the relative salience of the variables. Chapters 3 and 4 use the results of the corpus analysis to explore how the dominance of SPMSS affects speech processing.  The first of the two perception experiments is a phonetic categorisation task. Listeners decide whether they hear the word bed or bad in a condition where the stimuli are either set to music, or appear in one of two non-musical control conditions. The stimuli are on a resynthesised continuum between the dress and trap vowels, passing through an F1 space where the vowel is ambiguous and could either be perceived as a spoken NZE trap or a sung dress. When set to music, the NZ listeners perceive the vowel according to expectations of SPMSS (i.e. expecting US-derived vowel qualities). The second perception experiment is a lexical decision task that uses the natural speech of a NZ and a US speaker, once again in musical and non-musical conditions. Participants’ processing of the US voice is facilitated in the music condition, becoming faster than reaction times to their native dialect.  Bringing the results of the corpus and perception studies together, this thesis shows that SPMSS is highly normative in NZ popular music not just for performers, but also in the minds of the general music-listening public. I argue that many New Zealanders are bidialectal, with native-like knowledge of SPMSS. Speech and song are two highly distinct and perceptually contrastive contexts of language use. By differing from conversational language across a range of perceptual and cognitive dimensions, language heard or produced in song is likely to encode and activate a distinct subset of auditory memories. The contextual specificity of such networks may then allow for the abstraction of an independent sub-system of sociophonetic knowledge specific to the musical context.\nhttps://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/items/4026429a-a08d-4e16-a4e9-0441e9bf5eb0"

More specifically, I will be investigating the paucity of /b/ in the forms reconstructed for the ancient, hypothetical language. As cross-linguistic evidence and phonological theory alone have fallen short of providing a satisfactory answer, herein will I employ modern empirical methods of linguistic investigation, namely laboratory phonology experiments and computational database analysis. Following Byrd 2015, I advocate for an examination of synchronic phenomena and behavior as a method for investigating diachronic change. In Chapter 1, I present an overview of the various proposed phonological systems of PIE and some of the explanations previously given for the enigmatic rarity of PIE /b/. Chapter 2 presents a detailed account of three lab phonology experiments I conducted in order to investigate perceptual confusability as a motivator of asymmetric merger within a system of stop consonants.

There is a unique relationship regarding the language contact between Spanish and LP, where the maintenance of this English based language can certainly be complicated by a Spanish language dominant environment. Studying the historical migration of this Afro-Caribbean population to Costa Rica in the 1800s sheds light on the systemic oppression and the lack of integration into Costa Rican society that Afro-Costa Ricans faced in the midst of their arrival to Puerto Viejo (“the old port”). I conducted 8 sociolinguistic interviews with Limón Patwa speakers with efforts to better understand the usage of Limón Patwa, along with valuable information about being of African descent and living in Costa Rica. In addition to interviews with Patwa speakers, a matched guise audio survey was elicited to that involved listening to speakers of Patwa vs speakers of Spanish along with one audio recording of a Patwa speaker using Spanish. A Likert scale was used for participants to rate these voices as trustworthy, intelligent, and friendly, for example, in order to analyze how Patwa speakers are perceived by the general population. Furthermore, this research gives insight to where negative ideologies surrounding Limón Patwa and its speakers may stem from and how it influences the usage of LP. This study takes into consideration the issues of political power and the aspects of language identity, calling to attention the importance of efforts to maintain this minority language among an underrepresented community.\nhttps://doi.org/10.13023/etd.2019.352"

Throughout the course, we will llay out some basic and general, foundational concepts, and then have you start supplying the kernels of ideas. Then, each day we will work through crucial issues, such as assumptions about speakers and sampling, production and perception, measuring aspects of behavior and the idea of indices, and finding and interpreting background information on the topic.

    "text": "“Trust him not with your secrets, who, when left alone in your room, turns over your papers.” – Johann Kaspar Lavater\nI think e-mail is basically garbage and should be used as sparingly as possible and only for the things it’s really good at: receipts, tracking, pushing announcements, and sharing links/access to higher bandwidth means of communication.\nIt’s bad at facilitating communication. E-mail is more time-expensive than an actual conversation with only a fraction of the communicative bandwidth. It offers zero opportunity for real time ambiguity resolution. It is less efficient than a forum (such as discord or slack), and just generally terrible at almost all of the purposes it’s normally put to.\nWorse, it’s unhealthy. No one should have a world-writeable todo list. The people who expect you to read and attend to every one of their messages immediately are also, too often, the same people who want to forward you every bit of litter that falls into their inbox or send you constant, unnecessary updates, newsletters, check-ins, and ‘friendly’ reminders1. E-mail is terrible. But e-mail is also personal; it belongs to its user.\nUnfortunately, also, capitalism. Even at the University where I work, which should be above such things, aspiring fascist administrators and their toady IT staff routinely modify, scan, delete, and monitor users’ e-mail. It is used as a tool of control. Just last year, my University reached into our inboxes and deleted a message from our Union coordinating some activism. You can’t trust e-mail for personal communication, it is an instrument of your oppression, and it’s usually the worst tool for collaborative woirk.\nCan we please stop using an outmoded collaboration tool that amounts to sifting through a public litterbox multiple times per day to see if maybe one of the neighborhood cats dropped anything we might want in there?"
