Students are encouraged to get together with Pam or Kevin to run their ideas past us before submitting their paper, which is due 7-18 (11:59 pm).\n\n\nPart 1: Perception of variability due to phonetic context\n\nJune 24: Phonetic variation: noise in signal that listeners tune out or useful information that facilitates perception? Broad theoretical approaches to perception of acoustic variation\nSpeech perception research has always drawn attention to acoustic variation and the complex relation between acoustic signal and linguistic percept. Interpretation of some experimental findings, such as categorical perception (a phenomenon we’ll experience ourselves), has emphasized listeners’ ability to seemingly ignore or “abstract away” phonetic details in making perceptual judgments. Yet other findings show listeners to be malleable perceivers who are sensitive to fine-grained phonetic variation. Readings: Liberman et al. 1957, McMurray et al. 2002\nJune 27: Perceiving coarticulatory variation Coarticulation is a main source of contextual variation: due to overlapping articulatory movements, the acoustic realizations of consonants and vowels differ depending on the phonetic context in which they occur. Listeners accommodate or “compensate” for coarticulation, attributing the acoustic effects of overlapping gestures to their coarticulatory source. … Or do they? Interpretation of compensatory responses has been controversial for 35 years. We’ll discuss the relevant evidence in order to better understand why compensation for coarticulation has remained an important testing ground for gesturalist vs. auditory theories of speech perception. Readings: Mann 1980, Lotto & Kluender 1998, Fowler 2006, Lotto & Holt 2006\nJuly 1: Gesturalist theories of speech perception: Motor Theory and Direct Realism\nTheories of speech perception differ in their conception of the information that listeners recover from the acoustic signal. Gesturalist theories posit that the recovered information is for vocal tract actions. Early empirical motivation for Motor Theory included findings (such as from categorical perception) consistent with perception paralleling articulation more closely than acoustics. For Direct Realism, perception of vocal tract actions follows from the more general perspective that perceptual systems perceive the events that cause the lawful structure in the input signal. Our discussion of these theories will consider not only the nature of perceived information but also the fundamental question: Is speech (perception) special? Readings: Liberman & Mattingly 1985, Fowler 1996, Whalen 2019\nJuly 3: (Wednesday) Perceivers as producers of contextual variation\nPhonetic theory aims to explain the principles of human speech production and perception that underlie transmission of a linguistic message: speakers produce articulations with acoustic consequences that convey the planned linguistic information to listeners. Thus, understanding the relation between perception and production is central to phonetic theory. It is similarly central to theories of the phonetics of sound change, many of which assume a tight perception-production link such that individual listeners’ percepts are publicly manifested in their own productions. We will end this first half of the course by considering listeners as speakers, innovators, and members of speech communities whose speaker-specific production of contextual variation reflects their listener-specific perceptual use of that variation. Readings: Ohala 1981, Beddor 2009, Beddor et al. 2018\n\n\n\nPart II: Perception of variability due to talker differences\n\nJuly 8: Auditory and Exemplar theories of speech perception To begin the second half of the course, we will return to our investigation of the ways in which theories of speech perception construe the task. Specifically, what is the object of perception? In contrast to gesturalist theories, auditory theories posit that the recovered information from an acoustic signal is the auditory signal itself. But, as with gestural theories, we still face the difficulty of how listeners map highly variable acoustic information onto (perhaps) surprisingly consistent percepts. Exemplar theories (Goldinger and Johnson in this week’s readings) propose one possible solution to this mapping problem by suggesting that listeners draw on their detailed experience with language use to process new experiences with speech. Readings: Diehl et al. 2004, Goldinger 1998, Docherty & Foulkes, 2014\nJuly 11: Approaches to vowel perception: Whether gestural, auditory, or exemplar, any theory of speech perception must explain how listeners perceive particular vowel qualities and virtually all speech perception researchers agree on what the basic questions are and what evidence about vowel perception must be explained in a satisfactory theory. Today we will consider evidence and theories that have emerged over time from Joos 1947 to work that is accepted but not yet available in print. We will begin with the acoustics and articulation of vowels, experience some vowel perception studies first hand, and think together about what the different theories we have explored might have to say about vowels. Readings: Peterson & Barney 1952, Ladefoged & Broadbent 1957, Strange & Jenkins 2013, Johnson 2006, McGowan and Babel 2020\nJuly 15: Perceiving social variation: perceptions of identity among native speakers and listeners Gender is a main source of variation attributable to talker differences: due to differences in vocal fold thickness, vocal tract length, but also social expectations. Listeners accommodate gender differences, attributing the acoustic effects of gender difference to their biological source. … Or do they? Listeners’ use of gender (and sexuality) information in the voice has been of central interest to sociophonetic perception and to speech perception research more generally for decades. We will discuss some of the key evidence and implications for theory. Readings: Strand & Johnson 1996, Clopper & Pisoni 2004, Mack & Munson 2010, Sumner et al. 2014\nJuly 18: Perceiving social variation: why do people believe non-native speakers are difficult to understand? Linguists and non-linguists share a common belief that understanding the speech of non-native speakers is unusually difficult. As theorists and researchers we should always be wary of our own unexplored assumptions and biases, but perhaps this is even more true when these assumptions and biases can lead otherwise well-intentioned scientific research to reinforce existing inequality. In today’s class we will attempt to bring everything we have learned so far about speech perception, assessing a theoretical position, and listeners’ use of sources of variability in speech to assess the extent to which non-native speech is, or is not, especially problematic for listeners. Readings: Rubin 1992, McGowan 2015, Baese Berk 2019 (popular science article, short and accessible)"

This study, comprised of a listening task and post-task survey, therefore seeks to contribute to the fields of second language acquisition, psycholinguistics, and foreign language pedagogy by addressing German learners’ auditory processing of cognates as it relates to useful and authentic TL use in the classroom. Ten students in beginner German courses listened to German words and provided their English cognates, in order to determine which factor(s) most impacted processing: phonological (dis)similarities, morphological (dis)similarities, or TL lexical (in)frequency. A linear mixed effects analysis found that lexical items with lower frequency coincided with higher response times, and the post-task survey focused on student perspectives indicated that participants consider longer words, varying types of context, and transfer from other languages (including the L1) to be most helpful in their TL development. Altogether, these findings suggest that the moderated use of cognates is most helpful in combination with other linguistic support such as body language, as well as learner strategies like segmentation, in order to take advantage of frequently occurring morphemes in the TL lexicon. This warrants more intentional stylistic use of the TL and classroom dictation exercises to up the frequency of exposure to TL sounds and lexical items.\nhttps://uknowledge.uky.edu/ltt_etds/69/"

This study found that participants were less able to correctly detect the level of creaky voice in the female speaker for the lower half of the continuum when compared to the male speaker.\nhttps://uknowledge.uky.edu/ltt_etds/17/"

    "text": "How do we model the relationship between “high level” social constructs and “low level” automatic processing of phonetic detail? Variation in pronunciation is socially informative, and listeners can draw on these social expectations when perceiving speech. This dissertation argues for a closer consideration of variation within sociophonetic exemplar modeling. I do this by reviewing the web of literature, simulating perception events in Python, and conducting an experiment. “Exemplar theory” is a class of models positing that past experiences interpreting stimuli are remembered as exemplars; new stimuli are categorized based on comparison to these stored memories. In particular, I focus on the Generalized Context Model (Nosofsky 1986; Johnson 1997), or GCM. The evidence that social categories, like other higher-order abstractions from stimuli, can play a role in categorization is well-established but loosely unified. Many adopt an episodic or exemplar-based framework in interpreting their results, but focus on the general patterns more than a specific model. I developed a Python library ExemPy which implements the GCM and provides routines for simulating common perception experiment tasks. I suggest applications for both enhancing empirical work and exploring theoretical space. I designed an experiment to explore a key difference among sociophonetic priming literature: whether social expectation is invoked as part of or outside of the phonetic stimulus. Taken together, this work advances an integrative, ecologically informed approach to exemplar-based sociophonetic research, drawing on multiple sources of evidence to contextualize our modeling.\nhttps://www.proquest.com/openview/633e57c9ca44f19ecf97c41c1c04f9bf/1"

More recent studies have established that listeners are sensitive to cues in both these modalities which inform their perception of a speaker’s identity in parallel with the linguistic message, but the relationship between social information in perception and production together is unclear. This study reports the results of an experiment designed to test the hypothesis that expectations about a speakers identity is able to influence a listener’s perception and production of speech in tandem. The shadowing task addresses the degree to which listeners faithfully reproduce L2 accented English when presented with four ethnically distinct faces in congruent and incongruent auditory-visual pairs in a within-subject design. Analyses of the degree of acoustic similarity to model talkers in speakers’ imitations revealed a slight average trend toward convergence on vowel spectra, vowel duration, and average fundamental frequency. Significant predictors of the degree of change in a speaker’s production were shown to be the vowel quality measured and the voice presented, but these predictors were agnostic with respect to whether these changes represented phonetic convergence or divergence. The variance in degree of similarity suggests that speakers’ convergence is subject to linguistic selectivity, but it is less clear the role social selectivity plays when presented with unfamiliar varieties. Overall these findings are consistent with exemplar models which consider the inherent coupling of individuals’ speech perception and production, but that the visual stimuli had no significant effect on these analyses may be reflective of listeners’ adaptive processes during perception of L2-accented speech.\nhttps://uknowledge.uky.edu/ltt_etds/41/"

What remains unclear is how this interactive processing can affect behavioral responses such as responses to imperatives. To answer this question,71 participants were presented with a series of commands given in a relevant affect.Commands were read either with angry prosody, happy prosody, or neutral prosody (control) and the participants were instructed to press the requested button on a response box as quickly and accurately as possible. All emotional states were simulated and normed for perceived emotion, rather than induced. On average, participants responded 50ms slower to the commands which were performed with angry prosody than to the control (neutral prosody), and 164 ms slower when that angry prosody was given in a pragmatically relevant situation: after an incorrect response (see 4.1.) There was no significant difference between responses to happy prosody commands and the control. This difference in response time may be due to the heightened neurological responses to angry stimuli (Fr ̈uhholz and Grandjean, 2013). These results are consistent with a model of speech perception in which linguistic and social in-formation are processed simultaneously and interactively (Sumner et al., 2014), but not with a model in which emotional aspects of the speech signal are discarded or irrelevant to perception. The latency of the response to the pragmatically relevant angry commands observed in experiment two reinforces the findings from experiment one, where angry affect slows response time to commands.\nhttps://uknowledge.uky.edu/ltt_etds/40/"

    "text": "Given how complicated Introductory Phonetics (Lin 500) feels, it seems like probably people should misunderstand each other a lot more than we do. Yet, we have little difficulty recognizing the sounds of speech and assigning a meaningful interpretation to sequences of speech sounds. This course investigates how listeners interpret the input acoustic stream as a linguistic message. It is structured as both an introduction to the study of perception and then an overview of some of the classic problems unique to speech perception. The course also introduces students to the relation between theory and experimentation, and to experimental design, in this interdisciplinary field. This goal is addressed in two ways. First, we will read and assess the primary literature for a focus topic: the influence of linguistic experience on speech perception. Through this lens, students will get a detailed picture of how specific theoretical questions are translated into an experimental design, and how those results in turn lead to theory revisions and engender new questions. Second, the course will take a hands-on approach to the experimental study of speech perception. Students will participate in classic perception experiments in order to better understand the phenomena as well as the experimental methods. In addition, class participants will design (and maybe execute!) their own perception experiment."

An additional 15% may be awarded for work that is also correct. Any formative assignment that does not receive full credit may be revised and resubmitted for re-evaluation.

If you get an idea from a source, cite that source (both to show the research work you’ve done and to credit the people who have influenced your thinking). Buying a paper from someone, using Generative AI, or copying something from the internet are each obviously plagiarism and unacceptable, but plagiarism includes behaviors students sometimes find surprising. Paraphrasing someone else’s writing in your own words (without citing them) is plagiarism. Citing something you did not read based on someone else’s commentary on that book or paper is plagiarism. Be thoughtful, give credit where it is due, and do your own work and you won’t have any problems.\nWhat is Cheating? Before taking or giving answers to a quiz, test, homework, transcription, etc. to someone else, please ask yourself what the point or value of earning a university degree is if you aren’t going to do the work yourself? I do not look kindly on cheating which includes such insidious behaviors as taking a Canvas exam or quiz and then sharing the answers with a group chat.\nGenerative AI use for any assignment is strictly prohibited. Idea generation, analytical thinking, and critical analysis are key outcomes in this course. As a result, all assignments submitted by the student must be 100% their original work. Generative AI tools, including Grammarly, should not be used for any stage of any assignment or activity. Any submission of AI-generated content (even if you paraphrase the output) will be considered misuse in the context of this course and consequences will follow University policies. See the University Senate guidelines found here. Beyond this, Generative AI is terrible at phonetics and phonology. I guarantee you can do a better job yourself.\nAcademic Misconduct Process"

Successful completion of each puzzle unlocks the next one.\n\n\n\n✓ Participation\nParticipation is assessed bi-weekly based on my notes. You are invited to meet with me about an assessment you feel is unfair. Final participation grade is is the mode (not mean or median) of biweekly assessments and will be used to calculate this 10% of your final grade.\n\n5 points : Student comes to class prepared; contributes readily to the conversation; shows an interest in and respect for others’ contributions; participates actively in all groups\n4 points : Student comes to class prepared; contributes only occasionally to the conversation; or participates minimally in groups\n3 points : Student comes to class but preparation is not clear; only minimally contributes to the conversation or is distracted (e.g. on phone, browsing the web, etc.); does not engage with others’ contributions; or listens but does not contribute to group work\n2 points : Student has been habitually late, occasionally absent (unexcused, see below) or unprepared for class; does not contribute to the conversation unless called on; is occasionally disrespectful of others’ contributions; or is disengaged from group work (e.g. on phone, browsing the web, etc.)\n1 point : Student frequently does not attend class (unexcused, see below); habitually avoids answering questions or contributing to the conversation; rejects participation in groups; or brings an aardvark to class.\n\n\n\n✓ IPA Practice\n\nWe will do a mix of small in-class and online IPA transcription or reading exercises.\n\n\n\n✓ Midterm & Final\n\nThis course includes two opportunities to demonstrate what you have learned at the mid-point and end of the semester."

If you get an idea from a source, cite that source (both to show the research work you’ve done and to credit the people who have influenced your thinking). Buying a paper from someone or downloading something from the internet is obviously plagiarism and unacceptable, but plagiarism includes behaviors students sometimes find surprising. Paraphrasing someone else’s writing in your own words (without citing them) is plagiarism. Citing something you did not read based on someone else’s commentary on that book or paper is plagiarism.\nFaculty Senate Rules 6.3.2 apply in this course for instances of cheating Before taking or giving answers to a quiz, test, homework, transcription, etc. to someone else, please ask yourself what the point or value of earning a university degree is if you aren’t going to do the work yourself? I do not look kindly on cheating which includes such insidious behaviors as taking a Canvas exam or quiz and then sharing the answers with a group chat.\nGenerative AI use for any assignment is strictly prohibited. Idea generation, analytical thinking, and critical analysis are key outcomes in this course. As a result, all assignments submitted by the student must be 100% their original work. Generative AI tools should not be used for any stage of any assignment or activity. Any submission of AI-generated content (even paraphrased output) will be considered misuse in the context of this course and consequences will follow University policies. See the University Senate guidelines found here. Beyond this, Generative AI is terrible at phonetics and phonology.

These are designed to highlight key concepts and to ensure that you do not fall behind.\nYou will receive one checkmark for each completed reading quiz. You must complete 10 (of 15) to obtain the full 25% toward your final grade.\nImportant: reading quizzes can not be completed after the class period for which they are due (see due dates on the tentative schedule below). #### ✓ Language Puzzles\nFor each language puzzle you will receive curated speech sound data (in the form of IPA transcriptions or audio recordings) and a set of exploratory questions about those data.\nYour task is to apply theoretical knowledge and practical skills from our readings and class discussions to interpret and understand the data.\nComplete all five (5) language puzzles to obtain the full 25% toward your final grade. Successful completion of each puzzle unlocks the next one. #### ✓ Participation Participation is assessed every 4 class meetings based on my notes. You are invited to meet with me about an assessment you feel is unfair. Final participation grade is the mode (not mean or median) of biweekly assessments and will be used to calculate this 10% of your final grade.\n5 points : Student comes to class prepared; contributes readily to the conversation; shows an interest in and respect for others’ contributions; participates actively in all groups\n4 points : Student comes to class prepared; contributes only occasionally to the conversation; or participates minimally in groups\n3 points : Student comes to class but preparation is not clear; only minimally contributes to the conversation or is distracted (e.g. on phone, browsing the web, etc.); does not engage with others’ contributions; or listens but does not contribute to group work\n2 points : Student has been habitually late, occasionally absent (unexcused, see below) or unprepared for class; does not contribute to the conversation unless called on; is occasionally disrespectful of others’ contributions; or is disengaged from group work (e.g. on phone, browsing the web, etc.)\n1 point : Student frequently does not attend class (unexcused, see below); habitually avoids answering questions or contributing to the conversation; rejects participation in groups; or brings an aardvark to class.\n✓ IPA Practice\nThere will be 8 transcription practice modules on Canvas for you to unlock by listening and practicing\nTranscription: there are ~10 individual transcription items (words or syllables) per module. You can obtain the full 10% toward your final grade by completing all 80 items successfully.\n\n\n\n✓ Midterm & Final\n\nThis course includes two opportunities to demonstrate what you have learned at the mid-point and end of the semester.\nIn each exam you will be presented with original language data and you will be asked to find patterns in these data."

    "text": "“The thing about speech is, it varies.” (Remirez, in press). But for a number of historical and disciplinary reasons (see McGowan, in press), it feels normal for people in my field to talk about how listeners are “confronted with” tremendous variation in speech or to think about and write about variation as a big problem that listeners have to solve. I think this is a real shame.\n\n\n\nHi! My research takes the position that listeners are sensitive to patterns of covariation in speech and that knowing (more on ‘knowing’ later) these subtle patterns is part of what it means to truly know a language.\n\n\n\n\nWhy? Because speech is social. When we speak, we communicate not only our ideas, but also numerous social cues about who we are, where we come from, what we think you already know, who we think is listening, and many other details…\n\n\n\nWhich is great because if people sound the way we expect them to, we’re able to understand them better (McGowan, 2015; 2012 LSA presentation)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is true even when our expectations are based on stereotypes rather than authentic experience (McGowan, 2016)!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sumner, Kim, King, and McGowan (2014) we propose a model (below) of how the linguistic and the social aspects of speech interact to support perception.\n\n\n\n\nIn this model, we propose that listeners process both phonetically cued social information and phonetically cued linguistic information (this is Meghan Sumner’s excellent terminology) prior to word recognition and that these dual routes can interact to guide and facilitate perception.\n\n\n\nFor example, when Anna Babel and I told Bolivian listeners to expect Quechua-accented Spanish, they perceived vowels completely differently than if they were told to anticipate a Spanish accent (McGowan and Babel, 2020)\n\n\nThis suggests that experienced listeners have detailed knowledge of phonetically-cued social information —so expecting the variation consistent with a particular social category can change the way we perceive vowels. Social information isn’t noise to be thrown away, it is an essential part of the signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here’s that word know again! Knowledge is not the same thing as awareness. We told listeners they’d changed speakers (from Quechua to Spanish or vice versa) and while they gave every indication of believing the switch their low level perceptual behavior stayed the same!\n\nnbsp;\n\nBut what would happen if, instead of misleading listeners about the identity of the talker, we explicitly told them to ignore the guise information?\n\n\n\nThe answer is nothing! There is no difference in listeners’ use of the visual guise when told to ignore it/that it is meaningless (see figure, left). But, when Kyler Laycock and I conducted a Matched-Guise Experiment in which visual information about the gender of the talker was sometimes congruent with the voice and sometimes incongruent with the voice, we replicated the Strand Effect, the second experiment of Strand & Johnson (1996) in which visual information influences listeners’ perception of fricative consonants (top row of figure).\n\n\n\nBut, similar to the results of the 2nd guise presentation in Bolivia and with Chinese-accented English among experienced listeners, when the gender information in the voice and the visual presentation were incongruous, it once again appears that listeners attend more strongly to the acoustic signal than to the visual signal (bottom row of figure). It is unclear if this would happen with a more convincing/informative visual signal (e.g. video); so we’re testing this now.\n\n\n\n\nSo does all this knowledge and sensitivity only apply to social variation?\n\n\n\nFirst, some quick background on how sounds like [p], [t], and [k] differ from sounds like [b], [d], and [g] at the beginning of English words like pit and bit. What word is this native American English speaker saying? Does it sound like ‘pit’ or ‘bit’ to you?     Your browser does not support the audio element. \n\n\n\n The image to the left is a spectrogram (frequency analysis over time) of the word pit. Hear the puff of air at the beginning? It is highlighted in blue.    Your browser does not support the audio element.  \n pit and bit both start with the lips completely closed. One of the main differences between them is the duration of the puff of air, this duration is called VOT (voice onset time).    Your browser does not support the audio element. \n \n\n[pʰɪt]\n\n\n[bɪt]\n\n\n\nAt least in American English, that puff of air is so important that if we cut it out of pit (this was that first sound you played! ‘pit’ with the puff removed) it results in a word that sounds to English-knowing listeners a lot like bit —though probably with maybe a funny [b], and that funniness is every bit as interesting and important as the change from [p] to [b]!\n\n\n\nAnother covarying feature is the way vowels before nasal consonants in English tend to be nasalized. Listeners can use this as soon as it becomes available, not only a large distinction like bend/bed…   Your browser does not support the audio element.    Your browser does not support the audio element. \n\n\nbut also a much more subtle distinction like the difference in nasalization between these two sound files. Can you hear a difference?\n\n\n\n This first recording has late nasalization starting 100 miliseconds after the [b].   Your browser does not support the audio element. \n This second recording has early nasalization starting 33 miliseconds after the [b].   Your browser does not support the audio element. \n\n\n\n\nIn an eye tracking task we found that listeners can use nasalization as soon as it is present. Looks to the heavily-nasalized word were, on average, 60 ms faster —the same average difference between early and late nasalization in the recordings (Beddor, McGowan, Boland, Coetzee, and Brasher, 2013).\n\n\n\n\nWhether the information is social, contextual, articulatory, or idiosyncratic, we humans have an astonishing ability to attend to it, remember it, and activate it during perception. This ability, my research suggests, is not irrelevant to linguistic competence or even peripheral to it, it is fundamentally and centrally part of what it means to know and speak a human language.\n\n\n Thank you for reading!

I strive to build educational opportunities that provide structured access to knowledge and the encouragement for students to explore and synthesize that knowledge themselves. I want to engender a healthy distrust for the obvious while feeding or reviving an innate respect for the wondrous complexity that surrounds us. In practical terms this means things like curating assigned readings and providing support for them so that a curious reader can discover, for themselves, a coherent path. I provide assignments, and grading structure, that encourage play and the kind of low-stakes opportunities to experience informative failure and eventual success that are necessary for learning."

    "text": "This course is an introduction to the linguistic diversity of the United States and the role of language in the production and negotiation of various forms of social difference (e.g., ethnicity, gender, region, etc.). The course examines the ways in which language serves to construct social categories and the relationship between language and identity, emphasizing the ways in which individuals use language to present themselves as a specific type of person. The course also outlines linguistic and social implications of non-standard English dialects and multilingualism in American society. Emphasis will be given to questions of power and resistance related to language use in the contexts of government, education, and business. Students will learn how to collect information about language use and analyze it to develop informed opinions about situations in which linguistic differences have implications for issues of social equality and justice."

    "text": "Course Requirements\n\nFormative vs Summative and Late Grading Types\nMy goal is to reward intellectual exploration and play and to minimize the inhibitory fear of grading/grades. For this reason, there are two types of grading:\n\nFormative assignments will receive 85% of full credit simply by being an earnest effort that is handed-in on time. An additional 15% may be awarded for work that is also correct. Any formative assignment that does not receive full credit may be revised and resubmitted for re-evaluation. The only way to receive less than 85% on formative work is to not do it or to cheat (e.g. using LLMs or other generative AI in any way, see below)\nSummative assignments are graded when they are due and may not typically be revised and resubmitted without extenuating circumstances (e.g. excused illness)\nLate Work Whether formative or summative, late work will lose 5% of its maximum potential grade for each full week the assignment is late.\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nWeight\nType\n\n\n\n\n✓ Assignments (x 5)\n40%\nformative\n\n\n✓ Participation\n10%\nformative\n\n\n✓ Midterm\n25%\nformative\n\n\n✓ Final Project\n25%\nsummative\n\n\n\n\n✓ Assignments\nAssignments for this class (distributed via Canvas) are short activities based on the content of course lectures and reading assignments. Most of these assignments are individual efforts, though some may require students to work in groups. No cheating (including the use of generative AI) will be tolerated. There will be five (5) such assignments. Due dates for these assignments are listed in the course schedule below.\n\n\n✓ Participation\nYou are expected to attend each class and to have done the reading assigned for that day. In the course schedule, readings appear next to the day on which they are due. I recommend that you take notes on the readings and come prepared with questions or comments to contribute to class discussion. Your participation grade will be based on participation questions that are sprinkled throughout the lectures.\n\n\n✓ Exams\nThere will be two in-class exams: a midterm and a final. The final is not cumulative and will only cover the material after the midterm exam."

    "text": "Plagiarism & Academic Integrity\n\nWhat is Plagiarism? Summary: Do not present others’ work as your own. If you get an idea from a source, cite that source (both to show the research work you’ve done and to credit the people who have influenced your thinking). Buying a paper from someone, using Generative AI, or copying something from the internet are each obviously plagiarism and unacceptable, but plagiarism includes behaviors students sometimes find surprising. Paraphrasing someone else’s writing in your own words (without citing them) is plagiarism. Citing something you did not read based on someone else’s commentary on that book or paper is plagiarism. Be thoughtful, give credit where it is due, and do your own work and you won’t have any problems.\nWhat is Cheating? Before taking or giving answers to a quiz, test, homework, transcription, etc. to someone else, please ask yourself what the point or value of earning a university degree is if you aren’t going to do the work yourself? I do not look kindly on cheating which includes such insidious behaviors as taking a Canvas exam or quiz and then sharing the answers with a group chat.\nGenerative AI use for any assignment is strictly prohibited. Idea generation, analytical thinking, and critical analysis are key outcomes in this course. As a result, all assignments submitted by the student must be 100% their original work. Generative AI tools, including Grammarly, should not be used for any stage of any assignment or activity. Any submission of AI-generated content (even if you paraphrase the output) will be considered misuse in the context of this course and consequences will follow University policies. See the University Senate guidelines found here. Beyond this, Generative AI is terrible at phonetics and phonology. I guarantee you can do a better job yourself.\nAcademic Misconduct Process"

In this class we will use the Muppets to help us understand speech perception and speech perception to help us understand the Muppets. We will design and build our own puppet characters and we will see how Muppeteers take advantage of our core human facility with social and linguistic meanings to build characters and tell stories. We will see how our ideas about age, race, gender, sexuality, size, color, and fluffiness are activated by different voices and body shapes to create believable personas from felt and foam."

These are designed to exercise key concepts and to ensure that you do not fall behind.\nYou will receive one checkmark for each completed reading assignment. You must complete 15 (of 19) to earn the full 50% toward your final grade. You earn points by doing the work, not for agreeing with me or with the author.\nImportant: reading questions can not be completed after the class period for which they are discussed (see due dates on the tentative schedule below) unless circumstances require an exception.\n\n\n\nProject 1: Design a Character & Voice\n\nManipulate phonetics and social meaning to design a puppet voice for a particular character. Who is this character? What does such a character sound like? What are the social and ethical consequences of your decisions?\n\n\n\nProject 2: Design a Puppet\n\nDesign a puppet that embodies your character. Is your character furry? Why? What kind of clothes do they wear, if any? Do they have some feature that helps you build character (e.g. Kermit has no foam so the puppeteer’s hand performance is more exposed; Sam Eagle has “living hands” so he can more completely express his frustration; Cookie Monster’s pupils swing freely; etc.).\n\nBoth projects will be graded on design effort, thoroughness, and integration of course materials – not implementation abilities so we are free to challenge ourselves and take risks in construction and performance. Trust yourself. Be bold. Try things you don’t think you can do!\n\n\nFinal Presentation\n\nI will hand off emceeing of the final presentations to McGurk, the puppet I will also be building this semester. Yours can be a character presentation by you -or- a character performance/presentation by your puppet. Assessment will be based on a rubrik (see Canvas) and peer evaluations."

Data may come from something that already exists (e.g., data from the Linguistic Atlas Project, the published grammar of a language, an existing corpus, examples from a previously published paper or papers, etc.) or, with permission of the instructor, may represent a small, original experiment, survey, or computational project;\nLearn style conventions in Linguistics and a subdiscipline of choice;\nLearn to typeset Linguistics papers;\nParticipate in frequent discussions and workshops as you and your peers develop your capstone projects;\nProduce, through a series of multiple submissions and revisions, a substantial final paper of 4,500 to 6,000 words (roughly 15 - 20 double-spaced pages);\nCommunicate, at the end of the semester, the outcome of your project to your peers and faculty in a brief research presentation with media and style appropriate to the chosen subfield.\n\nNote on Graduate Composition and Communication Requirement: To satisfy the requirements of the GCCR, students must earn an average grade of C or better on the designated Composition and Communication (C&C) assignments in this course. The requirements for all GCCR courses include:\n\none or more written assignments in English that total to at least 4,500 words (the equivalent of 15 pages of double-spaced, typewritten text);\neither an oral assignment in English, in which students must give a formal presentation at least 10 minutes long, or a visual assignment, in which students create at least one significant visual/electronic artifact (e.g., a web site or video presentation);\nan assignment in English that requires the student to demonstrate information literacy in the discipline.\n\nIn this course, students will work on an original research project throughout the course, and they will present their findings to their peers. The final paper must be at least 4,500 words long (approximately 15 pages total). Throughout the course, students will produce multiple drafts and receive feedback from both peers and the instructor."

Why cant bnick or fnaishl be a word of English? Why does your Japanese friend think you get a Big Mac at Makudonarudo? What properties do sound patterns share across every language in the world, and in what general ways do they diﬀer? Much of this course will focus on patterns within and among sound segments, but later we will talk more about larger phonological units like syllables and words.\nTeach you to analyze phonological data like a scientist. Throughout the course we will look at lots of languages. In each case, you will look at some data, see patterns in that data, describe them as carefully as you can, use a theory to capture those patterns, and then assess how well the theory works – or even compare two theories abilities to capture the same data. In the first two thirds of the course, the theory we will use is one of phonological rules. In the later weeks, we will entertain a diﬀerent theory that uses ranked constraints.\n\nlin515_Spring2018.pdf"

The first group consisted of 42 students from the Latin Students Association (LSA) with Spanish-English backgrounds who were subdivided in three groups according to their language’s history, monolinguals (L1), early bilinguals (L1-2), and late bilinguals (L2). The second group consisted of 10 monolingual English speakers from the Linguistics department. Both groups performed a transcription task plus an emotional prosody rating from 60 videos of a native English speaker in two conditions: MASK and NO MASK. Participants in both groups obtained more accurate results in the NO MASK perception tasks.\nhttps://uknowledge.uky.edu/ltt_etds/45/"

The study combines quantitative methods of acoustic analysis and experimental design with qualitative methods of semi-structured interviews and content analysis. The study focuses on second language speakers’ variation in ‘passing for a native speaker’, that is, being regarded as a first language speaker. Variation in passing is explored from the perspectives of variation in production and perception. 18 second language speakers of English (first language Korean and German) and 6 first language speakers of English were recorded in four different settings (family, friends, services, and university). In the production study, the second language speakers’ monophthongal vowels are analyzed in comparison with the first language vowels and New Zealand English ones. The speakers were found to style-shift in their production of the first and second formants of certain vowels in different settings: the German speakers were more English-target-like in the services setting and the Korean speakers were more English-target-like in the services setting and less English-target-like in the family setting compared to the university one, exhibiting a continuum of native-likeness in the three settings. Three perception experiments complement the production analysis. Two of these focus on the effect of setting in accentedness perception and passing for a native speaker, and one explores the effect of social information (namely, ethnicity) on accentedness perception. The speakers were found to receive a different accentedness rating depending on the recording setting and whether or not the listener was aware of their ethnicity. Specifically, some speakers were rated less accented in the services setting and some in the family setting compared to the university one. Also, Asian speakers were rated similarly for accentedness both when the listeners were provided with video input and when they were not, but Caucasian speakers were rated more accented when the video input was available. Additionally, the thesis addresses passing for a native speaker of different English varieties in an experimental context. It reveals interesting trends in the speakers’ variation of passing in different settings and passing for native speakers of different varieties. The family setting was conducive to passing, and some speakers passed for a native speaker of the same variety more often than for a native speaker of other varieties and some vice versa. Finally, the second language speakers’ beliefs about passing and listeners’ comments on their decision-making in identifying the origin of the speakers are investigated. The results showed that the speakers believed that first (and short) encounters with strangers were conducive to passing. A variety of linguistic and extralinguistic listener comments was revealed. Taken together, the results paint a complex picture of variation in second language speakers’ production, accentedness perception, and passing for a native speaker. The findings suggest that speakers vary in their production according to audience and in the construction of their identities. The perception experiments highlight the effect of listener expectation on their perception. These results have implications for how we understand sociolinguistic variation in second language speakers.\nhttps://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/items/7a56f9f9-0e55-4eb8-b1aa-b93ed37c37cf"

    "text": "This thesis examines the flexibility and context-sensitivity of speech perception by looking at a domain not often explored in the study of language cognition — popular music. Three empirical studies are presented. The first examines the current state of sociolinguistic variation in commercial popular music, while the second and third explore everyday listeners’ perception of language in musical and non-musical contexts. The foundational assumption of the thesis is that the use of ‘American English’ in song is automatic for New Zealand singers, and constitutes a responsive style that is both accurate and consistent. The use of New Zealand English in song, by contrast, is stylised, involving an initiative act of identity and requiring effort and awareness. This will be discussed in Chapter 1, where I also introduce the term Standard Popular Music Singing Style (SPMSS) to refer to the US English-derived phonetic style dominant in popular song.  The first empirical study will be presented in Chapter 2. Using a systematically selected corpus of commercial pop and hip hop from NZ and the USA, analysis of non-prevocalic and linking /r/, and the vowels of the bath, lot and goat lexical sets confirm that SPMSS is highly normative in NZ music. Most pop singers closely follow US patterns, while several hip hop artists display elements of New Zealand English. This reflects the value placed on authenticity in hip hop, and also interacts with ethnicity, showing the use of different authentication practices by P¯akeh¯a (NZ European) and M¯aori/Pasifika artists. By looking at co-variation amongst the variables, I explore both the apparent identity goals of the artists, and the relative salience of the variables. Chapters 3 and 4 use the results of the corpus analysis to explore how the dominance of SPMSS affects speech processing.  The first of the two perception experiments is a phonetic categorisation task. Listeners decide whether they hear the word bed or bad in a condition where the stimuli are either set to music, or appear in one of two non-musical control conditions. The stimuli are on a resynthesised continuum between the dress and trap vowels, passing through an F1 space where the vowel is ambiguous and could either be perceived as a spoken NZE trap or a sung dress. When set to music, the NZ listeners perceive the vowel according to expectations of SPMSS (i.e. expecting US-derived vowel qualities). The second perception experiment is a lexical decision task that uses the natural speech of a NZ and a US speaker, once again in musical and non-musical conditions. Participants’ processing of the US voice is facilitated in the music condition, becoming faster than reaction times to their native dialect.  Bringing the results of the corpus and perception studies together, this thesis shows that SPMSS is highly normative in NZ popular music not just for performers, but also in the minds of the general music-listening public. I argue that many New Zealanders are bidialectal, with native-like knowledge of SPMSS. Speech and song are two highly distinct and perceptually contrastive contexts of language use. By differing from conversational language across a range of perceptual and cognitive dimensions, language heard or produced in song is likely to encode and activate a distinct subset of auditory memories. The contextual specificity of such networks may then allow for the abstraction of an independent sub-system of sociophonetic knowledge specific to the musical context.\nhttps://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/items/4026429a-a08d-4e16-a4e9-0441e9bf5eb0"

There is a unique relationship regarding the language contact between Spanish and LP, where the maintenance of this English based language can certainly be complicated by a Spanish language dominant environment. Studying the historical migration of this Afro-Caribbean population to Costa Rica in the 1800s sheds light on the systemic oppression and the lack of integration into Costa Rican society that Afro-Costa Ricans faced in the midst of their arrival to Puerto Viejo (“the old port”). I conducted 8 sociolinguistic interviews with Limón Patwa speakers with efforts to better understand the usage of Limón Patwa, along with valuable information about being of African descent and living in Costa Rica. In addition to interviews with Patwa speakers, a matched guise audio survey was elicited to that involved listening to speakers of Patwa vs speakers of Spanish along with one audio recording of a Patwa speaker using Spanish. A Likert scale was used for participants to rate these voices as trustworthy, intelligent, and friendly, for example, in order to analyze how Patwa speakers are perceived by the general population. Furthermore, this research gives insight to where negative ideologies surrounding Limón Patwa and its speakers may stem from and how it influences the usage of LP. This study takes into consideration the issues of political power and the aspects of language identity, calling to attention the importance of efforts to maintain this minority language among an underrepresented community.\nhttps://doi.org/10.13023/etd.2019.352"

I conducted 8 sociolinguistic interviews with Limón Patwa speakers with efforts to better understand the usage of Limón Patwa, along with valuable information about being of African descent and living in Costa Rica. In addition to interviews with Patwa speakers, a matched guise audio survey was elicited to that involved listening to speakers of Patwa vs speakers of Spanish along with one audio recording of a Patwa speaker using Spanish. A Likert scale was used for participants to rate these voices as trustworthy, intelligent, and friendly, for example, in order to analyze how Patwa speakers are perceived by the general population. Furthermore, this research gives insight to where negative ideologies surrounding Limón Patwa and its speakers may stem from and how it influences the usage of LP. This study takes into consideration the issues of political power and the aspects of language identity, calling to attention the importance of efforts to maintain this minority language among an underrepresented community.\nhttps://doi.org/10.13023/etd.2019.352"

Throughout the course, we will llay out some basic and general, foundational concepts, and then have you start supplying the kernels of ideas. Then, each day we will work through crucial issues, such as assumptions about speakers and sampling, production and perception, measuring aspects of behavior and the idea of indices, and finding and interpreting background information on the topic. If all goes well, each student should have the basics of a research project sketched out."

    "section": "",
    "text": "CSS should make the creation and sharing of standard interlinear glosses/translations easy; so far it does not. In general, either the text entry or the output (or both!) is absolutely unacceptable. For example:\n&lt;h1&gt;John 3:16&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"unit\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"gk\"&gt;οὕτως&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"en\"&gt;such&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"unit\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"gk\"&gt;γὰρ&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"en\"&gt;for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"unit\"&gt;&lt;p class=\"gk\"&gt;ἠγάπησεν&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"en\"&gt;loved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n \nNotice that any sense of these translated words having some pairwise (let alone phrasal, clause, or sentence!) structure is completely shrouded in the cumbersome and obtrusive markup (this would also be a huge pain to type). The output is admittely really nice and allows one to do some cool things with javascript, but the text is essentially unusable in this form. If I wanted 4,000,000 tags per document I’d use XML/XSLT (p.s. yuck).\nThe goal, it seems,is something more like the entry one uses in gb4e.sty glosses in a LaTeX document:\n\\begin{exe} \n\\ex \n\\gll Wenn jemand in die W\\\"uste zieht ... \\\\ \nIf someone in the desert draws and lives ... \\\\ \n\\trans ‘if one retreats to the desert and ... ’ \n\\end{exe} \n \ngb4e/LaTeX handle making words that are glosses of one another line up in the display. In short, the goal is separation of content from display and that’s the entire bloody point of CSS, right?\nWhat I’d really like is text entry like this:\n&lt;div class=\"interlinear\"&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"source\"&gt;T&aacute; ceol agam. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"gloss\"&gt;to be-PRS music-M.PL at-1SG&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"target\"&gt;I am musical&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n \nIn addition to the problem that CSS is basically incapable of doing any kind of interesting text alignment, this example introduces the complication of aligning multiple words to a single word. What I have so far is text entry using the CSS inline-table attribute like this:\n&lt;div class=\"interlinear\"&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"gloss\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"gll\"&gt;T&aacute;&lt;br /&gt;to be-PRS&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"gll\"&gt;ceol&lt;br /&gt;music-M.PL&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"gll\"&gt;agam&lt;br /&gt;at-1SG&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"translation\"&gt;I am musical&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n \nwhich, I think, still totally sucks. There’s less markup than the first version so it’s slightly better, but it’s still not very good. Two good things, though, are that the CSS is obvious, simple and standard (interlinear.css) and the output is nice:\n\n\n\nIrish\n\n\nTáto be-PRS\n\n\nceolmusic-M.PL\n\n\nagamat-1SG\n\n\n\nI am musical\n\n\n\nLatin\n\n\nIn  in\n\n\nnomine  name\n\n\nPatris  Father\n\n\net  and\n\n\nFilii  Son\n\n\net  and\n\n\nSpiritus  Spirit\n\n\nSancti  Holy\n\n\n\nIn the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n\nClassical Japanese (Ariwara no Narihira courtesy E.

This allows me to write markup in the style I want but it’s gross and still doesn’t facilitate searching. I’ll update this page when I come up with something better (or you could e-mail me if you have a better idea)."

    "title": "Forced-alignment and segmentation of airflow data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An airflow system like the SQLab EVA2 used in our lab creates separate wav-like files for audio, oral airflow, and nasal airflow. Usually we use a program like wavesurfer or Praat to view these files and extract our measurements.\nBut what if you want to extract measurements for all of the segments in a reasonably-sized corpus of continuous speech? This can, of course, be done by hand but the process is tedious, labor-intensive, and inescapably subjective. This tutorial explains how to use Praat and HTK to segment audio recordings and use that segmentation to extract phone-level airflow data for an entire corpus. The segmentation is unlikely to be as good as a trained linguist might achieve, but it’s definitely faster and a very good starting point. The corpus I’m working with is a set of recordings of the TIMIT prompts I made for my doctoral candidacy qualifying project: Modeling Airflow for Concatenative Speech Synthesis.\nSolution\n\nConvert the EVA2 files to WAV format.\n\nSQLab distribute a piece of Windows-only, closed-source software called RIFF Edit for converting from their proprietary format to WAV format. Works great on my Mac using CrossOver which, I believe, is just a very nice version of wine.\n\nBreak the audio recordings up into separate files (one prompt/sentence per file) Of course there are many ways to do this. Usually one would record each prompt separately so that the audio files are naturally in separate files. The clumsy EVA2 system makes this arrangement difficult, though, so I used a TextGrid to mark each prompt on an interval tier. This can be done automatically using Praat’s “Annotate –&gt; To TextGrid (Silences)” command (some clean-up is usually necessary, but it saves a lot of work). Once the prompts are marked in the TextGrid I run this Praat script that I did not write.\n\n( As a quick aside, Kyle Gorman has written a terrific little Python class for manipulating TextGrids –does exactly what you’d want in just exactly the way you’d probably expect. )\n\nNow use the same TextGrid and script to extract prompts from the OAF (oral airflow) and NAF (nasal airflow) files.\n\nThis is the great strength of using something like Praat in the first place. Be sure to check a random sample of your alignments to make sure everything worked, but I’ve never had a problem.\n\nLabel all three files properly\n\nMy utterances are in a file called utts.data (identical to the file needed by Festival for voice creation) with the format:\n(audio_0003 \"This was easy for us.\")\n(audio_0004 \"Jane may earn more money by working hard.\")\n(audio_0005 \"She is thinner than I am.\")\n(audio_0006 \"Bright sunshine shimmers on the ocean.\")\n(audio_0007 \"Nothing is as offensive as innocence.\")\n(audio_0008 \"Why yell or worry over silly items?\")\n(audio_0009 \"Where were you while we were away?\")\n \nAnd then I run the shell script mkpf.sh to double check the audio and create the prompt files.\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport UTTS=../utts.data\n\necho which file are we starting with [ 1 = first ]?\nread START;\n\nif [ \"$START\" == \"\" ]; then\n     START=1\nfi\n\nfor i in `ls a*.wav | sort -n -k1.2`; do\n    num=`printf \"%04d\" $START`\n\n    line=`grep \"audio_$num\" $UTTS`\n    prompt=`echo $line | awk -F\\\" '{print $2}'`\n    echo $line\n    afplay $i;\n    echo make $i $num [y] ?;\n\n    read ANSWER;\n\n    if [ \"$ANSWER\" == \"n\" ]; then\n        echo doing nothing\n    else\n        if [ \"$ANSWER\" == \"p\" ]; then\n            let \"START = START - 1\"\n            num=`printf \"%04d\" $START`\n\n            echo overwriting $i to $num ...\n        else\n            echo saving $i to $num ...\n        fi\n\n        cp $i audio_${num}.wav\n        cp oaf_$i oaf_${num}.wav\n        cp naf_$i naf_${num}.wav\n        echo $prompt &gt; ${num}.txt\n        rm $i\n\n        let \"START = START + 1\"\n    fi\ndone"
