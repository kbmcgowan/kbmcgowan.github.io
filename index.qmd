[Rusty Barrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Barrett), [Jennifer Cramer](https://linguistics.as.uky.edu/users/jsfrie0), and I had the great honor of revising [Rosina Lippi-Green's ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosina_Lippi) classic *English with an Accent* to bring it up to date with all of the research it has been so important in inspiring.   

[Jennifer Nycz](http://www.jennifernycz.com) described our new edition as the "updated-for-the-[3rd-wave](https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/thirdwave.html)" edition of EWAA, adding that "third-wave" is [her] academic translation of how they explain it ... clearly/accessibly and without jargon." And I could not be more thrilled with this description!

[Mike Mena](https://www.brooklyn.edu/faculty-staff/mike-mena/) [Reviewed the book enthusiastically on bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mikemena.bsky.social/post/3lekb4tqv2c2q)

We did [an episode of the Vocal Fries podcast about the third edition](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1930383/episodes/14886469-gorsh-we-all-have-accents.mp3?download=true)

## About 'Kevin Barry'

I'm named after a dance my mother choreographed for the *Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne* about a young fella who was somehow a medical student at a wizened 18 years of age and was executed by British occupying forces in 1920. The anglicization of the Irish name Caoimhín, 'Kevin' ['kʰɛ.vĩn] is, infamously, cognate with a German word meaning something like *thug* or, forgive me, *chav*.

## About 'McGowan'

Variously anglicized as *Mc Gowan*, *MacGowan*, *Gowan*, or even *Smythe* or *Smith*, my surname is from the Irish *Mac Gabhann* [mə'gɑ.wĩn] which, *Mac* indicating a son of *Gabhann* meaning blacksmith or smith. Similar anglicization happens with *Mac an Gabhann* and unrelated, but similar, names in Scotland such that `McGowan' is an incredibly common name.

## There's a lot of us.

- [Kevin J. McGowan](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/staff/kevin-mcgowan/), crow expert, is my favorite other Kevin McGowan, but don't tell that to
- [Kevin B. McGowan](https://www.mcra.com/our-team/kevin-mcgowan-phd) there are so many Kevin McGowans in the world that there is even another Kevin **B** McGowan who works on nasal stuff!
- [Kevin McGowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McGowan), baseball player, stole our wikipedia entry simply by being way more famous than the rest of us.
- [Kevin McGowan](https://vicfirth.com/blogs/artist/kevin-mcgowan), drummer & also possibly musician?
- [Kevin McGowan](https://www.janelia.org/people/kevin-mcgowan), molecular genomics
- [Kevin P. McGowan](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/newsobserver/name/kevin-mcgowan-obituary?id=53581809) statistical programmer, alas, is no longer with us.
- There are more, a lot more, but you get the idea.
