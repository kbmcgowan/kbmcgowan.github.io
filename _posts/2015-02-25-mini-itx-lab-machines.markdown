Computers are indispensable tools in a phonetics lab.  Ideally, they should be: **silent**, to allow high quality audio recordings suitable for phonetic analysis; **efficient**, to minimize the need for (potentially noisy) cooling in the lab and soundbooth; with reliable, **fast storage**; **powerful** enough, in terms of CPU speed and memory capacity, to run software like [Open Sesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/), [Audacity](http://web.audacityteam.org/), and [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) reliably and well; and **affordable**, because every dollar spent on unnecessary computing equipment is a dollar lost to science.

Unfortunately, like voicing and frication, these goals are at least somewhat incompatible.  Fast computers are hot and expensive.  Affordable computes are typically loud and slow.  Silent computers are very expensive.

If money were not an object, the solution would be a fanless
