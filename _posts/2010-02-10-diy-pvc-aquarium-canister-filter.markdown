I'm planning to build a new filter for my aquarium out of 3" PVC pipe. The goal is to make a filter that will operate at <=35dBA for as little money as possible and can be easily maintained.

The "mechanical & chemical" canister will be filled with 3" round mesh baskets full of filter floss and activated carbon. I could probably greatly simplify the design by dropping the heater unit (at least for now). I'd really like to get that thing out of the tank, though.
