Dolphins are great and all, but have you ever *seen* a living,
swimming tuna? They're bloody amazing.

o 3 cups cooked, drained chick-peas
o several spoonfuls of mayo-like substance
o 1 stalk minced celery
o 1 T nutritional yeast flakes
o 2 green onions, chopped
o 2 tsp soy sauce
o 1 teaspoon kelp powder (for that authentic "from the sea" flavor)
o kosher salt & fresh pepper, to taste

Mash up the chick peas; they deserve it. Seriously, take out all
of your aggression on these bastards. Throw everything else in the
bowl. Stir. Eat. Delicious.
