MacOS Catalina (10.15) broke many things on my computer, but the
one that has wasted the most of my time so far while I try to make
old PDFs available to vision-impaired students is the fact that
Apple broke Adobe Acrobat Pro and the nasty Creative Cloud license
manager that goes with it.  I lost most of a day trying to get all
that closed source nastiness working again before deciding to solve
the problem the way I always should have, with open source software.
This little script uses <a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/">ghostscript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a> to turn an image pdf into an OCRd version of
that pdf.
