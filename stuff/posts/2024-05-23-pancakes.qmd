These are good.  They're not as good as [Smitten Kitchen's tall, fluffy](https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/05/tall-fluffy-buttermilk-pancakes/), but my kids like them for dinner and *love* them cold them as morning commute snacks.

## Ingredients

### Dry
- $156$ g ($1\frac{1}{2}$ cups) rolled oats
- $230$ g ($1\frac{1}{2}$ cups) white whole wheat or ap flour
- $2$ tsp baking soda
- $1$ tsp baking powder
- $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp kosher salt

### Wet
- $1\frac{1}{2}$ cups vanilla yogurt
- $1$ cup milk
- $\frac{1}{4}$ cup peanut oil
- $1$ egg
- $1\frac{1}{3}$ cup light brown sugar
- $1$ tsp vanilla extract

### Optional
- $\frac{1}{3}$ cup chopped walnuts or dried cranberries or a mix

## Directions

1. Whisk dry ingredients in a large bowl
2. In another bowl, combine wet ingredients, stirring until smooth
3. Mix in dry ingredients just until combined, small lumps are fine
4. lightly butter a 350ยบ F (175ยบ C) skillet. I scoop batter with a #20 (yellow handled) disher (55 ml about 3.5 T). Cook for about 3 minutes/side or until brown. More butter makes crispier edges
