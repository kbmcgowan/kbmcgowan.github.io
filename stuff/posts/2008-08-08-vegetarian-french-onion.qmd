* 3 T olive oil
* 4 vidalia onions sliced thin
* 1 t kosher salt
* 1 T dijon mustard
* 1/4 t thyme
* 6 cups vegetable stock
* 2 T low sodium soy sauce
* 1.5 t sherry vinegar
* fresh pepper
* croutons (homemade, of course)
* grated swiss and parmesan cheese

Bring olive oil in dutch oven to medium heat. Add onions and salt, sweat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add mustard and thyme, stir well, cover.

Simmer over very low heat for 35 minutes.

Add stock, soy sauce, vinegar, and pepper. Simmer for another 10 minutes.

Ladle the soup into bowls and top with croutons and cheese. If your bowls are oven-proof, place the dishes under the broiler for a minute to melt and brown the cheese.
