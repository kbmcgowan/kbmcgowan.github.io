It's easy to find buttermilk pancake recipes and it's easy to find malted milk pancake recipes, but these days a malted & buttermilk pancake is a rare dish.

Improbably, this is the 2nd time I've felt [moved to write a post about a pancake recipe](/stuff/posts/2024-05-22-pancakes.html). But, whereas that previous recipe emphasized health or whatever, this recipe emphasizes neither of those things.

## Ingredients

### Dry
- $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp fine sea or table salt
- $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp baking soda
- $35$ g ($\frac{1}{4}$ cup) malted milk powder
- $120$ grams (~1 cup) all-purpose flour
- $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp vanilla extract

### Wet
- $2$ T (30 grams) unsalted butter, plus more for pan
- $2$ T (25 grams) granulated sugar
- $\frac{1}{2}$ cup plus 2 to 4 tablespoons buttermilk or yogurt
- $1$ large egg
- $1$ tsp vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Whisk dry ingredients in a large bowl
2. In another bowl, combine wet ingredients, stirring until smooth
3. Mix in dry ingredients just until combined, small lumps are fine
4. lightly butter a 350º F (175º C) skillet. I scoop batter with a #20 (yellow handled) disher (55 ml about 3.5 T). Cook for about 3 minutes/side or until brown. More butter makes crispier edges
