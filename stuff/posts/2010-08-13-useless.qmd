another process has my pipe
so I can't read and I can't write
now what am I for
on this long, lonely night
if I can't read and I can't write?

why do all we children have to fight
for time and attention of one named pipe?
now I'm all blocked up
no end of file in sight
and I can't read and I can't write.
