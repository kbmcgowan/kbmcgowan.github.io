I needed to be able to generate a number of figures for a phonetics
homework assignment showing an arbitrary number of component sine
waves and the complex wave you get if you sum them.

[TikZ](http://www.texample.net/tikz/) and
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) to the very enjoyable and useful
rescue!  The only tricky part is that Tikz wants to call gnuplot
to plot the functions.  I don't let LaTeX execute arbitrary commands
(for what are probably obvious reasons), but tikz generates
intermediate &lt;filename&gt;.gnuplot files so I just had to add a
line to execute these with gnuplot to the makefile for my homework
assignment.

**Example one:** and the code to create it.

```
\begin{tikzpicture}[domain = 0:16, samples = 1000]
%\draw[very thin, color = gray, step=1] (0,-2.75) grid(16,2.75);

% zero crossing
\draw[dotted] (0,0) -- (16,0);

% y axis and tick marks
\draw (0,3) -- (0,-3) node[below] {$amplitude$};
\draw (-.25,3) -- (.25,3) node at (-.5,3) {3};
\draw (-.25,2) -- (.25,2) node at (-.5,2) {2};
\draw (-.25,1) -- (.25,1) node at (-.5,1) {1};
\draw (-.25,0) -- (.25,0) node at (-.5,0) {0};
\draw (-.25,-1) -- (.25,-1) node at (-.5,-1) {-1};
\draw (-.25,-2) -- (.25,-2) node at (-.5,-2) {-2};
\draw (-.25,-3) -- (.25,-3) node at (-.5,-3) {-3};

% give some sense of time...
\draw (15.2,3) -- (15.2,-3) node[below] {$.01s$};

\draw[very thick, dashed] plot[id=a] function{sin(2.75 * x)};
\draw[thick] plot[id=b] function{1.25 * sin(5 * x)};
\draw[very thick, color = blue] plot[id=c] function{sin(2.75 * x) + 1.25 * sin( 5 * x)};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

**Example two:** and the code to create it.

\draw (6.25,3) -- (6.25,-3) node[below] {$4ms$};
    
\draw[very thick] plot[id=foo] function{sin(3*x)};
\draw[thick, dashed] plot[id=bar] function{2 * sin(x + 0.125)};
\draw[very thick, color = blue] plot[id=baz] function{sin(3*x) + 2 * sin(x + 0.125)};
\end{tikzpicture}
```
