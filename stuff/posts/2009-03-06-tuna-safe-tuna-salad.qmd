Dolphins are great and all, but have you ever *seen* a living,
swimming tuna? They're bloody amazing.

* 3 cups cooked, drained chick-peas
* several spoonfuls of mayo-like substance
* 1 stalk minced celery
* 1 T nutritional yeast flakes
* 2 green onions, chopped
* 2 tsp soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon kelp powder (for that authentic "from the sea" flavor)
* kosher salt & fresh pepper, to taste

Mash up the chick peas; they deserve it. Seriously, take out all
of your aggression on these bastards. Throw everything else in the
bowl. Stir. Eat. Delicious.
