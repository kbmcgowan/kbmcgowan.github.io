## Ingredients

### Dry
- $270$ g ($1\frac{3}{4}$ cups) bread flour
- $85$ g ($1$ cup) rolled oats
- $1$ tsp baking soda
- $6$ g ($1$ tsp) kosher salt

### Wet
- $2$ sticks of good quality softened butter (e.g. Irish)
- $\frac{3}{4}$ cup light brown sugar
- $\frac{3}{4}$ cup granulated sugar

### Finishing
- $1$ cup of Ghiradelli semisweet chocolate chips or break up an equivalent amount of a nice, bittersweet chocolate bar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375ยบ F (190ยบ C)
1. Combine the dry ingredients in a small bowl and set aside
1. Cream butter and sugars in a large bowl (I use a food processor)
2. Mix in eggs separately and then vanilla
3. Add dry ingredients and mix very well. I put on hearing protection and run the food processor for a couple of minutes.  You're building gluten.  Mmm ... gluten
4. add walnuts, process, drop in the chocolate bar and process or drop in the chocolate chips and stir 
3. Scoop onto cookie sheet with #20 (yellow handled) disher
5. optional: sprinkle with coarse salt
