This script fixes a weird problem when concatenating TextGrids and
sound objects.  Often a TextGrid and its associated sound object
will differ by anywhere from fraction of a millisecond to a few
milliseconds.

This is not a problem until you try to concatenate
the TextGrids and still align them with their concatenated sound
objects when suddenly intervals and points later in the chain will
begin to be increasingly misaligned.
