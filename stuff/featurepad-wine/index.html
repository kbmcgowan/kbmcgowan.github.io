	<h2>Running FeaturePad on Mac or Linux with Wine</h2>
	<p class="byline"><small>Last updated: January 23, 2012</small></p>

	<p><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405184124.html">FeaturePad</a> is a piece of software for learning phonological features and works well with Bruce Hayes' 2009 textbook, <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405184124.html">Introductory Phonology</a>.  What it does <b>not</b> work well with, unfortunately, are non-Windows computers.  Fortunately, there is the open source project <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> which provides users of non-Windows operating systems on Intel machines access to just enough Windows environment to run many different kinds of software without having to purchase and install Windows or run a full-blown virtualization environment.  Instructions for <a href="#linux">linux</a> follow the instructions for <a href="#macos">MacOS</a>.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="macos">Intel Macs</a></h2>

	<p>Apple switched to Intel processors starting in 2005; this works with Macs sold since then.  Known working with 10.6 (snow leopard) and 10.7 (lion).  Please let me know if you use these instructions whether they work/don't work for you.</p>

	<h3>Step 1: <a href="http://wineskin.doh123.com/tiki-index.php?page=Downloads">download Wineskin</a></h3>
		<p>
		There are many ways to get Wine running on your Mac.  The easiest way I've found is with <a href="http://wineskin.doh123.com/">WineSkin</a>.  <a href="http://wineskin.doh123.com/tiki-index.php?page=Downloads">Download Wineskin from its downloads page</a>.  Ignore the form that pops-up on the download page, you don't need to fill it in to get the zip file.
		</p>

	<h3>Step 2: Install and launch 'Wineskine Winery'</h3>
		<p>
		The main application you have just downloaded is a tool for putting a Windows-emulation wrapper around FeaturePad so it can run on your Mac.  You can run this from anywhere:  your Downloads folder, your Desktop, your Applications folder, it's really up to you.  When you have launched Wineskin, it should look like Figure 1.
		</p>

		<dl class="figure">
		<dt><img src="img/Figure1.png" alt="Figure 1: Wineskin main screen"/></dt>
		<dd>Figure 1: Wineskin main screen</dd>
		</dl>

	<h3>Step 3: Download a Wine 'engine'</h3>
		<p>We need to prepare your new copy of Wineskin to create stand-alone applications.  The first step is to download the Wine engine that will do the actual work.  In the upper-right corner of the Wineskin window there is an "Installed Engines" list;  this will be empty by default.  Click the plus sign button below this list and then click the "Download and Install" button (as shown in Figure 2) and click "OK" on the "File to download and install" window that appears.
		</p>

		<dl class="figure">
		<dt><img src="img/Figure2.png" alt="Figure 2: Wineskin: File to download and install window"/></dt>
		<dd>Figure 2: Wineskin: File to download and install window</dd>
		</dl>
	
	<h3>Step 4: Setup a Wine 'wrapper'</h3>
		<p>In the lower-right corner of the Wineskin Winery window, click the "Update" button to install a wrapper and click "OK" on the "File to download and install" window that appears.</p>

	<h3>Step 5: Click 'Create New Blank Wrapper'</h3>
		<p>Now, finally, on the left side of the Wineskin window, click the 'Create a New Blank Wrapper' button.</p>

		<p>In the "Create a Wrapper" window that appears, replace
		'MyCoolWrapper' with the name 'FeaturePad' (no quotes)
		and click "OK" (Figure 3).  This will almost certainly
		ask you to install Gecko (see Figure 4);  just click
		Install and wait for it to download and install.</p>

		<dl class="figure">
		<dt><img src="img/Figure3.png" alt="Figure 3: Create a Wrapper"/></dt>
		<dd>Figure 3: Create a Wrapper</dd>
		</dl>

		<dl class="figure">
		<dt><img src="img/Figure4.png" alt="Figure 4: Install Gecko"/></dt>
		<dd>Figure 4: Install Gecko</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>When it finally finishes, you'll see a
		"Wrapper Creation Finished" modal dialog.  Click "View
		wrapper in Finder" to continue (Figure 5).  You are now
		done with Wineskin and can safely quit the application
		if you like.
		</p>

		<dl class="figure">
		<dt><img src="img/Figure5.png" alt="Figure 5: View wrapper in Finder"/></dt>
		<dd>Figure 5: View wrapper in Finder</dd>
		</dl>

	<h3>Step 5: Download the FeaturePad and Font Installers we need </h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/120a/FeaturePad.htm">Get FeaturePad from Bruce Hayes' web site</a> (hard to find because the download link is the utterly uninformative word 'here').  It doesn't matter where you put it (Downloads folder is fine) as long as you remember what you did with it until step 6.
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/120a/featurepad/Ipa93dr.ttf">Get the SIL Doulos 1993 font</a> from the SIL downloads site.  (This font is obsolete and junky, don't use it for anything else.  FeaturePad will stop using it at some point too.).  Downloads folder is a good place to leave this too.

	<h3>Step 6: Install FeaturePad</h3>
		<p>Double-click on the FeaturePad icon you created in step 4 (it will have a red Wineskin icon).  This will bring up the "Wineskin" window shown in Figure 6.</p>

		<dl class="figure">
		<dt><img src="img/Figure6.png" alt="Figure 6: FeaturePad Wineskin first launch"/></dt>
		<dd>Figure 6: FeaturePad Wineskin first launch</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>Click "Install Windows Software" and navigate to SETUP.EXE for FeaturePad.  If you just let your web browser download and expand FeaturePad.zip into your Downloads folder, then this should look more or less like Figure 7. Select "SETUP.EXE" and click "Choose".<p>

		<dl class="figure">
		<dt><img src="img/Figure7.png" alt="Figure 7: Finder window"/></dt>
		<dd>Figure 7: Finder window</dd>
		</dl>

	<h3>Step 7:  Follow the FeaturePad installer instructions.</h3>
		<p>Click "OK" on the first grey screen that pops up.  Click the picture of an ancient computer with what appears to be a box of floppy disks in front of it on the next grey screen. Click "OK" on the "Setup Successful" screen.  Click "OK" on the "Choose Executable" pop up to choose "/Program Files/FeaturePad/FeaturePad.exe". Click "Quit" in the Wineskin window.</p>

	<h3>Step 8:  Install SIL Doulos 1993 font.</h3>

	<p>
		We're almost there.  In the Finder (file manager), control-click (aka right click) on the FeaturePad icon to bring up the menu shown in Figure 8.  Select "Show Package Contents".  This will give you access to all of the files wrapped up inside this tiny virtual Windows machine we're building.
	</p>

		<dl class="figure">
		<dt><img src="img/Figure8.png" alt="Figure 8: right click FeaturePad"/></dt>
		<dd>Figure 8: right click FeaturePad</dd>
		</dl>

	<p>
		Double-click on drive_c<br/>
		Double-click on windows<br/>
		Double-click on Fonts<br/>
	</p>

	<p>
		You should now have the Windows/Fonts folder open.  Now move the Ipa93dr.ttf file you downloaded in Step 5 into this folder.  Close up all of those Finder windows and you're done.
	</p>

	<h3>Double-click the FeaturePad icon to launch FeaturePad.exe on your Mac.</h3>

	<h2><a name="linux">Linux</a></h2>

	<p>Linux is easy.  Get the binary package from your distribution's package manager, download FeaturePad, run the installer, and you're done.  At least on my machines (ubuntu 11.10-based), all I had to do was:</p>

<pre>
   : optionally add personal package archive for lastest version
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa

   : update available package information and  install
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install wine1.3
</pre>

	<p>
	Download FeaturePad and the IPA font per the links in Step 5.  Double-click the FeaturePad SETUP.EXE to invoke Wine and run the installer.
	</p>

	<p>
	Finally, be sure to go back and follow the instructions above in Step 8 so you will have the IPA Doulos '93 font installed in your ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/Fonts directory.
