	    Humans have the uncanny ability to convert thoughts
	    into vibrating air molecules, perceive minute patterns
	    of vibration happening around their heads, and translate
	    those vibrations back into thoughts!  Nothing any science
	    fiction author could ever write about mind reading could
	    be as amazing, intricate, or subtle as speech.  This
	    course introduces students to the study of speech
	    production and perception and the nature of the acoustic
	    signal that is transmitted from speaker to listener.

	    This course is the first semester of an intensive
	    two-course introductory sequence to the scientific study
	    of human language, geared primarily for majors and
	    minors in Linguistics. Through frequent practice of
	    linguistic analysis in the form of problem sets, LIN/ENG
	    221 will provide students with a core foundation in
	    Linguistics, examining the five components of grammar:
	    phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics.
