	<h3>Introduction to Phonetics

	</h3>
	<p>
	Humans have the uncanny ability to convert thoughts into
	vibrating air molecules, perceive minute patterns of vibration
	happening around their heads, and translate those vibrations
	back into thoughts!  Nothing any science fiction author could
	ever write about mind reading could be as amazing, intricate,
	or subtle as speech.  This course introduces students to the
	study of speech production and perception and the nature of the
	acoustic signal that is transmitted from speaker to listener.
	The course goals are:
	</p>

	<ol>
	    <li> To understand fundamental principles of phonetic theory and phonetic representation. We will study current theories of the complex tasks accomplished by speakers and listeners and will arrive at a representation of speech sounds in terms of their articulatory (speaker-based), acoustic, and perceptual (listener-based) characteristics.
     
	    <li> To introduce students to phonetic experimentation and analysis.  Small-scale experiments will provide training in physiologic measurement, acoustic analysis and perceptual testing.  We will reinforce theoretical principles by performing empirical tests of claims.
     
	    <li>To consider articulatory, acoustic and perceptual properties as imposing a set of simultaneous constraints on the notion of ``possible speech sound'' and as contributing to the definition of ``possible speech sound system'' for human languages.  This consideration serves as a bridge from phonetics to future coursework many students will take in phonology.
     
	    <li>To provide practical experience in producing and transcribing sounds of the world's languages.

	<h3>Introduction to Phonology
	<p class="whenTaught">( Spring 2012, Spring 2013 )</p>
	</h3>
	<p>
	This course is designed to do two things:
	</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>Survey some basic phonological data: How do speech
	    sounds work, pattern, and interact across the world’s
	    languages? Why can’t *bnick or *fnaishl be a word of
	    English? Why does your Japanese friend think you get a Big
	    Mac at Makudonarudo?  What properties do sound patterns share
	    across every language in the world, and in what general ways
	    do they differ? Much of this course will focus on patterns
	    within and among sound segments, but later we will talk more
	    about larger phonological units like syllables and words.

	    <li>Teach you to analyze phonological data like a
	    scientist. Throughout the course we will look at <b>lots</b>
	    of languages.  In each case, you will look at some data,
	    see patterns in that data, describe them as carefully as you
	    can, use a theory to capture those patterns, and then assess
	    how well the theory works &mdash; or even compare two theories’
	    abilities to capture the same data. In the first two thirds
	    of the course, the theory we will use is one of phonological
	    rules. In the later weeks, we will entertain a different
	    theory that uses ranked constraints.

	<h3>Introduction to Linguistics
	<p class="whenTaught">( Summer 2008, Fall 2011 )</p>
	</h3>

	<p>
	This foundation course serves as an introduction to language
	and linguistics.  We will begin with the surprisingly difficult
	question, 'what is language?' and the related, but not
	identical, question 'what is <b>a</b> language?'.  We will
	examine the structure and use of language at all levels:
	social identity and register, how words mean (lexical and
	cognitive semantics), how words are built up from smaller parts
	(morphology) and how words are arranges in sentences (syntax).
	We will then discuss the physiology of speech (articulatory
	phonetics) and what the organization of speech sounds can reveal
	about the mind (phonology).  Finally, we will return to high
	level social questions with the study of language variation
	(sociolinguistics), the process and inevitability of language
	change (historical linguistics), the development and ideology of
	writing systems and the psychological underpinnings of language.
	</p>

	<p>
	Throughout the semester we will highlight the interdisciplinary
	nature of linguistics, especially as it relates to anthropology,
	sociology, mathematics and cognitive science.  Students will
	gain experience with hands-on data analysis from English and a
	number of other languages.

<div class="box" id="hearingAndPerception">
	<h3>Hearing &amp; Speech Perception
	<p class="whenTaught">( Spring 2012 )</p>
	</h3>
	<p>
	Experimental speech perception, which spans a period of more than
	60 years, investigates how listeners extract a linguistic message
	from the input acoustic signal.  From the discipline's earliest
	years, researchers recognized that the acoustic signal is highly
	variable and that perceptual processing is more complex (and
	interesting!) than a simple one-to-one mapping between acoustic
	property and linguistic percept.  Thus, much of the research in
	speech perception has been guided by the fundamental question
	of how listeners "cope" with acoustic variability to achieve
	perceptual constancy.
	</p>

	<p>How does speech perception differ from other types of auditory
	processing?  What is the relation between speech production
	and perception?  Are the primitives of speech perception
	auditory or articulatory?  Do perceptual primitives associate
	with smaller (features, phonemes) or larger (syllables, words)
	linguistic units?  How do listeners form perceptual categories
	from variable input, and what is the nature of the categories,
	or mental representations, that are formed?  How is perception
	reorganized developmentally due to a child's experience with a
	particular phonological system?  And in turn, how does perception
	influence phonological systems and phonological change?
	</p>

	<p>This course is a hybrid advanced course/seminar treatment
	of the relationship between acoustic signals and mental
	representations.  We will begin by concentrating on the human
	ear and psychoacoustics.  This will lead into a survey of the
	primary theories of speech perception.	 Finally, we will treat
	as many topics of special interest as we can before we run out
	of time and are forced to part.

	<h3>Advanced Phonology
	<p class="whenTaught">( Fall 2012 )</p>
	</h3>
	<p>
	As we have designed it together over the summer, this is not
	so much a course in how to <em>do</em> phonological analysis
	as it is a course in what phonology is.  We will, of course,
	get our hands dirty now and again and do some actual phonology,
	but for the most part we will be reading, thinking about, and
	discussing different theories of phonology.  We will evaluate
	the assumptions each theory makes about what language is and how
	it works.  Questions we will encounter include:  what should count
	as evidence for a theory of phonology?	is there any such thing
	as grammar?  how can we tell?  are there mental representations
	of abstract linguistic units and, if so, how abstract are they?
	what responsibility does the phonologist have for sociolinguistic
	variation, frequency differences, and coarticulatory patterns
	in a language?
    </p>

    <p>
	The specific course goals are:
    </p>

     <ol>
	 <li> To survey a representative (but by no means comprehensive) sample of phonological theories and to discuss their assumptions, goals, similarities, and differences.
          
	<li> To approach two or three of the big, active, intractable current problems in the linguistic analysis of sound and gesture and to use these problems to evaluate the theories we have surveyed.
	            
	<li> To practice writing critical analyses of theoretical and
	    empirical writing.

	<h3>Computational Linguistics
	<p class="whenTaught">( Spring 2013 )</p>
	</h3>

	<p>
	    This is an introduction to computational linguistics intended
	    primarily for students with a solid grounding in linguistic
	    theory &amp; methodology who wish to expand their toolkits
	    and world view to include computational
	    methods.  You will learn enough Python to <a
	    href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">think, just a bit, like a computer scientist</a>.	The full
	    course description is not yet available, but we will use <a
	    href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/slp.html">Jurafsky &amp; Martin, second edition</a> (be certain to get the
	    second edition!).
	</p>

	<p>
	    Students from computer science are, of course, also welcome.

	<p class="whenTaught">( <a href="http://lsa2013.lsa.umich.edu/">2013 LSA Summer Institute</a>, Stanford Summer 2014, LSA Annual Meeting 2015 )</p>
	</h3>
	<p>
	Praat is a software tool for recording, analyzing, playing,
	and modifying speech sounds in the course of linguistics research.
	It can also be used for behavioral experimentation, phonological
	simulations, statistical analysis, drawing &amp; plotting,
	corpus annotation, as a dessert topping, and also as a floor wax.
	Praat also includes a domain-specific scripting language that
	can be used to automate or streamline all of these tasks.
	</p>

	<p>
	This course introduces basic automation and scripting skills
	for linguists using Praat. The course will expand upon a basic
	familiarity with Praat and explore how scripting can help you
	automate mundane tasks, ensure consistency in your analyses,
	and provide implicit (and richly-detailed) methodological
	documentation of your research.  Our main goals will be:
	</p>

	<ol>
	    <li> To expand upon a basic familiarity with Praat by exploring the software’s capabilities and learning the details of its scripting language.

	    <li> To practice a set of scripting best practices to help you not only write and maintain your own scripts but evaluate scripts written by others.
	</ol>

	<p>
	The course assumes participants have read and practiced with the
	Intro from Praat’s help manual. Topics to be covered include:
	</p>

    <ul>
    	<li> Working with the Objects, Editor, and Picture windows
    	<li> Finding available commands
    	<li> Creating new commands
    	<li> Working with TextGrids
    	<li> Conditionals, flow control, and error handling
    	<li> Using strings, numbers, formulas, arrays, and tables
    	<li> Automating phonetic analysis
    	<li> Testing, adapting, and using scripts from the internet

	<h3>College Writing
	<p class="whenTaught">( Fall 2008 )</p>
	</h3>

	<p>
	Learning to write good college prose is a lot like learning to
	be a great cake designer.  The folks on Ace of Cakes can no more
	show up at a formal wedding with an animatronic Britney Spears
	cake (with sparklers) than they can show up with an undercooked
	puddle of Betty Crocker cake mix &mdash; at least, not if they expect
	to get paid.  A really great cake has to be delicious, of course,
	but it also has to be structurally sound, it has to be beautiful,
	and, crucially, it has to be appropriate to the party.
	</p>

	<p>
	Your writing is very similar.  You can write a well-structured
	logical argument with insightful commentary and mastery of your
	topic, but if it reads like a lost James Joyce short story
	or cribbed Radiohead lyrics you're unlikely to get an 'A'.
	Your job in college is not merely to understand what you're
	taught but to synthesize and demonstrate your learning <em>in the
	language appropriate to the party</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
	That's where this class comes in.  We're going to hone our
	writing skills, learn to pay attention to form as well as content,
	and get a lot of practice writing.

	<h3>Pseudorandom quotes from evaluations.
	<p class="whenTaught">( both positive &amp; negative... )</p>
	</h3>

	<p>
	&ldquo;I just wanted to thank you one more time for the tutorial. It was perfect, and really fun. You're a great teacher.&rdquo;
	</p>

	<p>
	&ldquo;Dr. McGowan is absolutely amazing. He is very entertaining and knowledgeable and always quick to answer questions and discuss concerns. His atmosphere and attitude are very informal, and even in a big class, he makes efforts to get to know his students personally and address their needs individually. I cannot imagine having a better instructor for anything. His lectures are never, ever boring and are full of pop culture references that engage students and enhance their understanding of the material. Also, he is hilarious and full of great advice. He took the time to get to know me and really helped to quell my qualms about being a linguistics major. He also doesn't get mad if you e-mail him lame linguistics jokes. If you have a chance to take a class from him, I cannot recommend enough that you do it. He is great.&rdquo;
	</p>

	<p>
	 &ldquo;He did a really great job of encouraging dialogue and responding
	 to comments and questions in a way that made students very
	 comfortable to voice their own ideas. The way he organized the
	 seminar subject matter was also very well planned and helped
	 students to begin to make sense of a large body of research in
	 just one semester. Highly recommended.&rdquo;
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 &ldquo;Really cool, great guy, but not a great professor:
	 pretty disorganized, lectures turned into discussions most of
	 the time and we fell waaaaay behind.&rdquo;
	 </p>

	 <p style="border: 1px black dashed; background-color: #cccccc; padding: 10px;">
	 Okay, I need to respond to this one.  The point about not being
	 a great professor is well taken.  However, turning lectures into
	 discussions was an <em>explicit goal I had for the class</em>
	 and certainly didn't happen by accident.  Furthermore, while
	 it's true that we didn't reach all of the topics laid-out on the
	 syllabus, it is not true, in any sense, that we `fell behind';
	 waaaaay or otherwise. &mdash;Kevin
	 <p>

	 &ldquo;He is by far the best teacher I've had at Rice. He
	 encouraged and facilitated thought in and out of class, taught
	 everything thoroughly and was able to present the material in
	 a way that was constantly engaging and interesting. Take any
	 class you can with this man!  &rdquo;
	 </p>

	 <P>
	 &ldquo;Dr. McGowan was an amazing teacher. His lectures were
	 very engaging, and he was also very friendly.&rdquo;
	 </p>

	 <P>
	 &ldquo;Dr. McGowan was very entertaining, but he also seemed
	 to know what he was talking about very well. He presented the
	 material in an engaging and informative way.&rdquo;
	 </p>

	 <P>
	 &ldquo;Dr. McGowan was an excellent professor--very engaging,
	 humorous, and intelligent. I looked forward to going to his
	 class, because he was such a good teacher. &rdquo;
	 </p>

	<p>
	 &ldquo;He tended to get off topic a lot, and it made the
	 actual content of his lectures really hard to follow. I got
	 lost a lot.&rdquo;
	 </p>

	 <p style="border: 1px black dashed; background-color: #cccccc; padding: 10px;">
	 I'm so sorry I lost you; I do wish you'd told me before the
	 evaluation, though.  What felt `off-topic' was <em>meant</em> to
	 be engaging and interactive.  Class time is precious and
	 there is a lot of work to do.	I know this.  What may feel
	 like a relaxed digression is almost always, in fact, a fairly
	 calculated attempt to repeat important material in a slightly
	 different and context-sensitive way.  I work harder now to
	 make the structure clearer and to relate these `digressions'
	 more explicitly to the original presentation of the material.
	 Thanks for letting me know. &mdash;Kevin
	 <p>

	 <p>
	 &ldquo;Kevin McGowan is awesome. Really, everyone loves him. He is
	 super funny but also really passionate about the subject. That
	 combination is IDEAL for a professor. And when do you ever
	 come across an ideal situation? Never. Except now. So if you're
	 thinking of hiring him, do it. If you're not thinking of hiring
	 him, you should start.&rdquo;
	</p>

	<p>
	&ldquo;Dr. McGowan is an absolutely outstanding professor and
	I don't think I've ever been so inspired to learn than in his
	classroom. &rdquo;
	</p>

	<!--
	<p>
	&ldquo;I loved loved loved Dr. McGowan! He had a bit of problems
	with turning back homework to the students and having homework
	putting up on time, but his lectures were very very fun and
	engaging. He's also quite a character! Very fun class&rdquo;
	</p>

	 <p style="border: 1px black dashed; background-color: #cccccc; padding: 10px;">
	 Thanks for the critique.  I work much, much harder now to get
	 assignments back within a week. &mdash;Kevin
	 </p>
	 -->

	<p>
	&ldquo;Dr. McGowan is hands-down one of my favorite professors ever in
	the history of my time at Rice. He's a very funny yet effective
	professor. Every time I went to his class I always expected to
	have a laugh and learn something absolutely fascinating. Not only
	is he a great lecturer in class, but he's also great outside
	of class in terms of assisting with homeworks and being pretty
	understanding needing more time. He's very approachable, sweet,
	and beyond knowledgable about his subject. I didn't know what
	to expect out of Phonology when I took it, but I was pleasantly
	surprised when I absolutely enjoyed his class and looked forward
	to attending lectures. He made it fun, interesting, and novel. I
	also had taken Phonetics with him, and while that was his first
	class that he taught and it was still in the beta-testing stages,
	I still had a great time and learned a lot. If Kevin McGowan is
	still around, take his class. Any of his classes. Please. You'll
	thank yourself, I promise.&rdquo;
