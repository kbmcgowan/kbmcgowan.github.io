<p>We humans have the uncanny ability to convert thoughts into vibrating air molecules, perceive minute patterns of vibration happening around our heads, and translate those vibrations back into thoughts! Nothing any science fiction author could ever make up about mind reading could be as amazing, intricate, or subtle as speech. This course introduces students to the study of speech production and perception and to the nature of the acoustic signal that is transmitted from speaker to listener.</p>

It’s in the basement, across from the Linguistic Atlas Project, and you get there by walking <em>through</em> the Geography Lab (see map). Come with questions, come to work on a problem set, come to play with the lab equipment (see your tongue in an ultrasound, try out an experiment, etc.), or just to say “hi!”</p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lab-exercises">✓ Lab Exercises</h4>
<ul>
<li>There will be four lab exercises posted to canvas that require you to analyze data, measure phonetic properties of a speech sound, label recorded data, and or run an experiment on yourself</li>
<li>Your task is to apply theoretical knowledge and practical skills from our readings and class discussions to interpret and understand the data.</li>
<li>Although called “Lab Exercises” these never need to be done in the lab as long as you have access to a computer with Praat and headphones.</li>
<li>Complete all four (4) lab exercises successfully to obtain the full 40% toward your final grade. Successful completion of each puzzle unlocks the next one.</li>
</ul>

<section id="participation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participation">✓ Participation</h4>
<p>Participation is assessed bi-weekly based on my notes. You are invited to meet with me about an assessment you feel is unfair. Final participation grade is is the mode (not mean or median) of biweekly assessments and will be used to calculate this 10% of your final grade.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5 points</strong> : Student comes to class prepared; contributes readily to the conversation; shows an interest in and respect for others’ contributions; participates actively in all groups</li>
<li><strong>4 points</strong> : Student comes to class prepared; contributes only occasionally to the conversation; or participates minimally in groups</li>
<li><strong>3 points</strong> : Student comes to class but preparation is not clear; only minimally contributes to the conversation or is distracted (e.g.&nbsp;on phone, browsing the web, etc.); does not engage with others’ contributions; or listens but does not contribute to group work</li>
<li><strong>2 points</strong> : Student has been habitually late, occasionally absent (unexcused, see below) or unprepared for class; does not contribute to the conversation unless called on; is occasionally disrespectful of others’ contributions; or is disengaged from group work (e.g.&nbsp;on phone, browsing the web, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>1 point</strong> : Student frequently does not attend class (unexcused, see below); habitually avoids answering questions or contributing to the conversation; rejects participation in groups; or brings an aardvark to class.</li>

<p>✓ Lab Exercises These exercises are identical to the Undergraduate assignments but with a few additional questions and, typically, a stricter grading rubric. ✓ Midterm and Final Exams Again, identical to the undergraduate requirement but with additional questions/opportunities to integrate knowledge across the curriculum ✓ Final Paper Each graduate or honors student will be asked to complete a 1,200 - 1,800 word term paper demonstrating original investigation of a phonetic (or laboratory phonological) question. Successful papers in the past have included: - work related to the students’ prospective thesis - a literature survey on a particular topic (e.g.&nbsp;perception of nasal coarticulation, phonetic correlates of stress in so-called stress timed vs syllable timed languages, the sociophonetics of gender) - an experimental proposal. Typically this will take the form of an experimental paper you have read that you would like to replicated and reinvestigate in a different way</p>

<section id="plagiarism-academic-integrity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plagiarism-academic-integrity">Plagiarism &amp; Academic Integrity</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/ao#Plagiarism">Faculty Senate Rules 6.3.1 apply in this course for plagiarism</a> Summary: Do not present others’ work as your own. If you get an idea from a source, cite that source (both to show the research work you’ve done and to credit the people who have influenced your thinking). Buying a paper from someone or downloading something from the internet is obviously plagiarism and unacceptable, but plagiarism includes behaviors students sometimes find surprising. Paraphrasing someone else’s writing in your own words (without citing them) is plagiarism. Citing something you did not read based on someone else’s commentary on that book or paper is plagiarism.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/ao#Cheating">Faculty Senate Rules 6.3.2 apply in this course for instances of cheating</a> Before taking or giving answers to a quiz, test, homework, transcription, etc. to someone else, please ask yourself what the point or value of earning a university degree <em>is</em> if you aren’t going to do the work yourself? I do <em>not</em> look kindly on cheating which includes such insidious behaviors as taking a Canvas exam or quiz and then sharing the answers with a group chat.</p></li>
<li><p>Generative AI use for any assignment is strictly prohibited. Idea generation, analytical thinking, and critical analysis are key outcomes in this course. As a result, all assignments submitted by the student must be 100% their original work. Generative AI tools should not be used for any stage of any assignment or activity. Any submission of AI-generated content (even paraphrased output) will be considered misuse in the context of this course and consequences will follow University policies. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/ao">University Senate guidelines found here</a>. Beyond this, Generative AI is <em>terrible</em> at phonetics and phonology. I guarantee you can do a better job yourself.</p></li>
