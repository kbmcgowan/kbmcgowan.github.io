    doi = {10.1177/0023830914565191}, 
    abstract ={Listeners' use of social information during speech
        perception was investigated by measuring transcription
        accuracy of Chinese-accented speech in noise while listeners
        were presented with a congruent Chinese face, an incongruent
        Caucasian face, or an uninformative silhouette. When listeners
        were presented with a Chinese face they transcribed more
        accurately than when presented with the Caucasian face.
        This difference existed both for listeners with a relatively
        high level of experience and for listeners with a relatively
        low level of experience with Chinese-accented English.
        Overall, these results are inconsistent with a model of
        social speech perception in which listener bias reduces
        attendance to the acoustic signal. These results are generally
        consistent with exemplar models of socially indexed speech
        perception predicting that activation of a social category
        will raise base activation levels of socially appropriate
        episodic traces, but the similar performance of more and
        less experienced listeners suggests the need for a more
        nuanced view with a role for both detailed experience and
        listener stereotypes.},

    issn={1664-1078},
    abstract={Spoken words are highly variable. A single word may
        never be uttered the same way twice. As listeners, we
        regularly encounter speakers of different ages, genders,
        and accents, increasing the amount of variation we face.
        How listeners understand spoken words as quickly and adeptly
        as they do despite this variation remains an issue central
        to linguistic theory.  We propose that learned acoustic
        patterns are mapped simultaneously to linguistic representations
        and to social representations.  In doing so, we illuminate
        a paradox that results in the literature from, we argue,
        the focus on representations and the peripheral treatment
        of word-level phonetic variation. We consider phonetic
        variation more fully and highlight a growing body of work
        that is problematic for current theory: words with different
        pronunciation variants are recognized equally well in
        immediate processing tasks, while an atypical, infrequent,
        but socially idealized form is remembered better in the
        long-term.  We suggest that the perception of spoken words
        is socially weighted, resulting in sparse, but high-resolution
        clusters of socially idealized episodes that are robust in
        immediate processing and are more strongly encoded, predicting
        memory inequality. Our proposal includes a dual-route
        approach to speech perception in which listeners map acoustic
        patterns in speech to linguistic and social representations
        in tandem. This approach makes novel predictions about the
        extraction of information from the speech signal, and
        provides a framework with which we can ask new questions.
        We propose that language comprehension, broadly, results
        from the integration of both linguistic and social information.}

    abstract = {The perception of coarticulated speech as it unfolds
        over time was investigated by monitoring eye movements of
        participants as they listened to words with oral vowels or
        with late or early onset of anticipatory vowel nasalization.
        When listeners heard [CṼNC] and had visual choices of
        images of CVNC (e.g., send) and CVC (said) words, they
        fixated more quickly and more often on the CVNC image when
        onset of nasalization began early in the vowel compared to
        when the coarticulatory information occurred later. Moreover,
        when a standard eye movement programming delay is factored
        in, fixations on the CVNC image began to occur before
        listeners heard the nasal consonant. Listeners' attention
        to coarticulatory cues for velum lowering was selective in
        two respects: (a) listeners assigned greater perceptual
        weight to coarticulatory information in phonetic contexts
        in which [Ṽ] but not N is an especially robust property,
        and (b) individual listeners differed in their perceptual
        weights. Overall, the time course of perception of velum
        lowering in American English indicates that the dynamics
        of perception parallel the dynamics of the gestural information
        encoded in the acoustic signal. In real-time processing,
        listeners closely track unfolding coarticulatory information
        in ways that speed lexical activation.}
